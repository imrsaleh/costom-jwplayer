You're gonna get
a veggie burger

01:35.149 --> 01:37.018
with sweet potato fries.

01:37.018 --> 01:38.785
You don't know
what I'm gonna get.

01:38.785 --> 01:39.820
Okay.

01:39.820 --> 01:41.156
You girls all set?

01:41.156 --> 01:42.657
Yeah. Can I get
the Chinese chicken salad

01:42.657 --> 01:44.559
- and a hot green tea, please?
Mmm-hmm.

01:44.559 --> 01:45.426
And for you?

01:45.426 --> 01:48.029
Um, can I please have...

01:48.029 --> 01:49.564
...the veggie burger?

01:49.564 --> 01:51.399
I think... I can't hear you.

01:51.399 --> 01:53.101
Veggie burger
with sweet potato fries, please.

01:53.101 --> 01:54.635
Okay.

01:54.635 --> 01:56.371
- Oh, and can I also have an...
...iced coffee?

01:56.371 --> 01:58.839
- Just black. Thank you.
- Black. Thank you.

02:00.707 --> 02:01.709
You don't know me.

02:01.709 --> 02:03.244
I do know you.

02:04.244 --> 02:05.480
What are you doing tonight?

02:05.480 --> 02:08.116
Um, I'm going to have dinner
with Ben.

02:08.116 --> 02:10.518
- Lucy!
- Jane!

02:10.518 --> 02:12.053
You have to put him
out of his misery

02:12.053 --> 02:13.149
and eff him already.

02:13.149 --> 02:14.722
You need to do that.

02:14.722 --> 02:17.258
What?
I absolutely do not!

02:17.258 --> 02:20.028
What's the problem?
He's great, you like him.

02:20.028 --> 02:21.462
You get to tell your kids
you met

02:21.462 --> 02:23.664
when his toilet overflowed
into your kitchen.

02:23.664 --> 02:26.767
- Lucy, he's in love with you.
- Hey. Hey, baby.

02:26.767 --> 02:29.804
Hi, babe. We just ordered.
I was starving. Hello.

02:29.804 --> 02:32.540
Oh, yeah? Well, thank you for
waiting that extra 30 seconds

02:32.540 --> 02:33.808
I told you it would take me
to park.

02:33.808 --> 02:36.011
Lucy's having dinner
with Ben tonight.

02:37.312 --> 02:39.114
What? Is tonight the night?

02:39.114 --> 02:40.781
Are we...

02:40.781 --> 02:41.882
ready?

02:41.882 --> 02:43.318
Why did you blow on it?

02:43.318 --> 02:45.153
Because it's dusty,
silly pants.

02:45.153 --> 02:46.988
We're friends, you guys.

02:46.988 --> 02:49.958
He's going to help me
install this new shelf.

02:49.958 --> 02:52.188
This poor bastard.

02:52.188 --> 02:53.761
- Let me tell you something.
- What?

02:53.761 --> 02:56.831
Before this lovely woman and I
made love to each other--

02:56.831 --> 02:58.633
Ew, no.
Don't say it like that.

02:58.633 --> 03:00.068
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

03:00.068 --> 03:02.003
Before we made love
in each other...

03:03.071 --> 03:04.439
...we were great friends,

03:04.439 --> 03:06.041
and I would've installed
anything for her.

03:06.041 --> 03:07.342
I would've built her a house.

03:07.342 --> 03:09.510
A very small,
conveniently-sized house.

03:09.510 --> 03:10.979
You wanna know why?

03:10.979 --> 03:12.880
Because I knew that was going
to lead to sex.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.283
I followed her around
like an idiot.

03:15.283 --> 03:16.517
I got a pedicure once.

03:16.517 --> 03:17.953
Desperately needed,
but he did.

03:17.953 --> 03:20.655
You guys, no.
We're seriously just friends.

03:20.655 --> 03:22.457
We shake hands
after we have dinner.

03:22.457 --> 03:24.359
Ew!

03:24.359 --> 03:25.760
- You guys shake hands?
- Yeah.

03:25.760 --> 03:27.362
- Why would you do...
For God's sake.

03:27.362 --> 03:28.997
Like...
Like, he's your accountant?

03:28.997 --> 03:31.227
- No, it's funny.
- It's not funny.

03:31.227 --> 03:32.667
No, I didn't laugh.
I didn't laugh one time.

03:32.667 --> 03:34.469
I'm telling you this
because I care.

03:34.469 --> 03:36.271
You need to fuck
or get off the pot.

03:36.271 --> 03:38.473
- I don't think that's how--
- Just do it.

03:38.473 --> 03:39.975
Do it.
Do it.

03:39.975 --> 03:41.042
- Do it.
- Do it!

03:41.042 --> 03:43.211
- Do it!
Do it!

03:43.211 --> 03:46.314
We did it!
Yay.

03:46.314 --> 03:48.816
How many paintings
do you think it can hold?

03:49.918 --> 03:51.247
It's sturdy.

03:51.247 --> 03:52.753
I don't know
if I'd put anything on it.

03:52.753 --> 03:54.655
I've never
used a drill before.

04:01.729 --> 04:02.530
Thanks.

04:02.530 --> 04:03.965
For all your hard work.

04:20.613 --> 04:23.518
- What is this?

04:24.317 --> 04:25.820
It's a Stella.

04:25.820 --> 04:27.923
It might be expired,
though, I...

04:27.923 --> 04:30.025
Uh, I don't really drink
a lot of beer,

04:30.025 --> 04:31.892
but it tastes like beer.
Mmm-hmm.

04:31.892 --> 04:33.728
That's not what I meant.

04:33.728 --> 04:36.131
- What did you mean?
- Oh.

04:36.131 --> 04:38.399
Oh!

04:40.400 --> 04:43.371
- Sorry.

04:43.371 --> 04:45.340
- I'm gonna go.
No, Ben.

04:45.340 --> 04:46.707
Why?

04:46.707 --> 04:49.510
Because you just catapulted
off the bed

04:49.510 --> 04:51.012
when I got close to you.

04:52.378 --> 04:53.848
I was caught off guard.

04:53.848 --> 04:55.683
Caught off guard is when
somebody tosses a ball at you

04:55.683 --> 04:57.252
and you flinch,
but you still catch it.

04:57.252 --> 05:02.623
You just slithered away
like Mr. Bean or something.

05:02.623 --> 05:05.460
I thought
we were just staying friends.

05:05.460 --> 05:07.495
But you're playing
all these love songs,

05:07.495 --> 05:09.297
like, really romantic ones.

05:09.297 --> 05:10.598
It's a playlist.

05:10.598 --> 05:13.434
It's called, "All The Feelz,"
with a z.

05:13.434 --> 05:15.103
I can see how
that would be misleading.

05:15.103 --> 05:19.374
I just liked it
because of the sadness.

05:21.241 --> 05:22.743
I'll see you later, Lucy.

05:34.255 --> 05:36.891
I forget, you do like it
when I say "I told you so,"

05:36.891 --> 05:39.460
- or you don't like that.

05:39.460 --> 05:40.795
Everything was okay

05:40.795 --> 05:42.530
until you put it out
into the universe.

05:42.530 --> 05:44.432
Why don't you just
sleep with him?

05:44.432 --> 05:47.268
- Because I don't want to.
- Oh, why not?

05:47.268 --> 05:48.469
I just don't.

05:48.469 --> 05:51.206
Hmm. May I venture a guess?

05:51.206 --> 05:52.807
- No.
- I think

05:52.807 --> 05:54.275
it's because you're afraid
of getting close to someone

05:54.275 --> 05:55.543
for fear of rejection.

05:55.543 --> 05:57.545
Or it could be
a fear of intimacy

05:57.545 --> 05:59.847
stemming from your youth,
your parents' bad marriage

05:59.847 --> 06:03.551
or something that happened
you can't even remember.

06:03.951 --> 06:05.086
No.

06:05.086 --> 06:07.355
Hi. Have you two been
in my class with before?

06:07.355 --> 06:09.290
We haven't.
Great.

06:09.290 --> 06:11.292
I love virgins.

06:11.292 --> 06:13.094
Wow. Oh, my God.

06:13.094 --> 06:15.463
You two were definitely
sisters in a past life.

06:15.463 --> 06:17.132
But one of you
betrayed the other

06:17.132 --> 06:20.601
and burned her at the stake
for being a witch.

06:20.601 --> 06:22.470
That feels
like a her thing to do.

06:22.470 --> 06:24.205
Anyways, if you need anything

06:24.205 --> 06:26.207
during the class,
just let me know.

06:26.207 --> 06:28.109
I do really bomb adjustments.

06:28.109 --> 06:29.945
-"Bomb adjustments."
- Thank you all for letting me

06:29.945 --> 06:31.746
be a part
of your practice today.

06:31.746 --> 06:36.151
Yoga is a great way to calm
our minds and our bodies

06:36.151 --> 06:39.620
and to become one
with ourselves and each other.

06:39.620 --> 06:41.856
So, today's class is gonna be

06:41.856 --> 06:44.420
a rap battle between Fetty Wap
and Lil Yachty.

06:52.033 --> 06:53.801
Do you really think
we were sisters?

06:53.801 --> 06:56.671
I don't think
someone named Sky Jade

06:56.671 --> 06:58.306
- would make that up.

06:58.306 --> 07:00.741
I hope I was the cool sister.

07:00.741 --> 07:02.310
I hope I was called Denise.

07:02.310 --> 07:04.512
What?

07:05.012 --> 07:06.014
Denise?

07:06.014 --> 07:07.682
Yeah. I've always wanted
to be Denise.

07:07.682 --> 07:11.086
That's so lezz.

07:11.086 --> 07:13.021
What? Was Nonce taken?

07:13.021 --> 07:14.522
No, but Nance was.

07:14.522 --> 07:16.557
- Nonce was available.

07:16.557 --> 07:18.093
Nobody's named Nonce.

07:21.694 --> 07:23.331
Don't you wanna have
a different name?

07:23.331 --> 07:24.599
Yeah!

07:24.599 --> 07:25.800
But I want it
to be something fun,

07:25.800 --> 07:28.403
like Frederica, Taraji.

07:28.403 --> 07:31.006
- You're Denise!

07:31.006 --> 07:34.809
I can't wait to only
call you Denise from now on.

07:34.809 --> 07:36.444
Can you please drop me off
at work

07:36.444 --> 07:38.346
so I don't have
to go home first?

07:38.346 --> 07:39.680
You got it.

07:44.450 --> 07:46.154
Going to the bathroom.

07:58.899 --> 08:00.735
I stole some tampons.

08:00.735 --> 08:02.498
- These are good ones.

08:02.498 --> 08:04.739
Call me later,
and take a shower

08:04.739 --> 08:06.341
because that is a tough smell
right now.

08:07.408 --> 08:09.344
Good morning, Luce.

08:09.344 --> 08:10.611
- Hi.
- Hi, my love.

08:10.611 --> 08:11.912
You're here early.

08:11.912 --> 08:14.115
Yeah, I was gonna
meditate with a view,

08:14.115 --> 08:15.316
but then I started making

08:15.316 --> 08:17.618
a mood board
on Pinterest so...

08:17.618 --> 08:19.620
Hi. I'm Jane.

08:19.620 --> 08:22.290
Hi, I'm Brittany.
Nice to meet you.

08:22.290 --> 08:23.791
Jane is my best friend.

08:23.791 --> 08:25.226
Brittany's a new
masseuse here.

08:25.226 --> 08:26.727
Oh, cool.

08:26.727 --> 08:28.896
- I love your best friend.

08:28.896 --> 08:30.665
She's a real doozy, isn't she?

08:32.033 --> 08:34.469
I'll see you later.
It was nice to meet you.

08:34.469 --> 08:35.971
You, too.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.475
Bye, Luce.

08:40.475 --> 08:43.711
Or Denise.
Or whatever your name is.

08:54.187 --> 08:55.723
Oh, my God.

08:55.723 --> 08:57.258
Jane, you have a second?

08:57.258 --> 08:58.659
Yeah, of course.

08:58.659 --> 09:01.229
Let me just finish
this work-related text.

09:01.229 --> 09:02.863
I want to talk to you
about something,

09:02.863 --> 09:04.865
and I want you
to listen closely.

09:05.965 --> 09:07.702
I've been going
through your emails

09:07.702 --> 09:10.566
and all of your
electronic communication.

09:11.404 --> 09:13.008
Listen...

09:13.008 --> 09:14.642
We just googled those penises.

09:14.642 --> 09:15.944
No one has that condition.

09:15.944 --> 09:17.545
Ah.

09:17.545 --> 09:18.980
I'm totally kidding.

09:18.980 --> 09:20.548
I honestly don't care
what you email about.

09:21.782 --> 09:23.251
Jane,
you're from London, right?

09:23.251 --> 09:25.987
Like, I'm sharp enough
to pick up on this twang.

09:25.987 --> 09:27.855
Yes. I mean,
I haven't lived there

09:27.855 --> 09:30.625
since I was, like, 16.
But, yes.

09:30.625 --> 09:33.728
Um, how would you feel about
opening up an office there?

09:34.227 --> 09:35.230
Seriously?

09:35.230 --> 09:36.932
Yeah, there's
a chocolate company

09:36.932 --> 09:41.002
that wants to give Cadbury
a real run for its Bunny.

09:45.604 --> 09:46.907
Isn't that clever?

09:46.907 --> 09:49.710
I thought of it
as I was saying it.

09:51.978 --> 09:53.609
They want our help
with the campaign,

09:53.609 --> 09:55.316
and I know
you'd be perfect for it.

09:55.316 --> 09:56.612
Honestly, I think you're ready

09:56.612 --> 09:58.386
to have a whole division
to yourself.

09:58.386 --> 10:01.122
That's an amazing offer.

10:01.122 --> 10:02.690
I...

10:02.690 --> 10:03.791
I don't know what to say.

10:03.791 --> 10:06.261
Well, I do. You can say yes.

10:07.462 --> 10:08.624
At least think about it,
all right?

10:08.624 --> 10:10.098
We'll make it
worth your while.

10:10.098 --> 10:12.400
- Okay. Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.102
Yeah, sure, sure.
Get out of here.

10:14.102 --> 10:15.170
Yeah.

10:17.570 --> 10:19.007
Actually,
you can leave it open.

10:19.939 --> 10:21.676
Actually, shut it.

10:21.676 --> 10:22.843
Not all the way.

10:22.843 --> 10:23.711
- That's good right there.
- Yep.

10:23.711 --> 10:24.946
Little more.

10:26.312 --> 10:27.215
Perfect.

10:41.729 --> 10:43.098
Did you get my text?

10:43.098 --> 10:45.366
<i>Yes. You are
such a strange person.</i>

10:45.366 --> 10:48.436
<i>- Can we get drinks later?</i>

10:48.436 --> 10:51.306
Um, yeah. Are you okay?

10:51.306 --> 10:53.841
<i>Yeah, it's just
dumb work stuff.</i>

10:53.841 --> 10:55.476
Okay, it's not cancer?

10:55.476 --> 10:57.445
<i>What? No. Goodbye.</i>

10:58.545 --> 10:59.647
- Hey.
- Ooh.

10:59.647 --> 11:00.815
- Whoa.

11:00.815 --> 11:01.677
- Sorry. Let me get that.
- Sorry.

11:02.750 --> 11:04.252
- Hmm.

11:04.252 --> 11:05.653
Whoa, that's incredible.

11:05.653 --> 11:07.322
Oh, I just like to doodle.

11:07.322 --> 11:09.724
It's better
than a doodle.

11:10.690 --> 11:12.994
I love that you can do that.

11:12.994 --> 11:14.395
- Meg?
Yes?

11:14.395 --> 11:16.331
- Are you ready to head back?
I'm ready.

11:30.804 --> 11:33.148
Sorry, I was
googling butt herpes.

11:33.148 --> 11:35.516
- Hello, Lucy.
- I got you a tequils.

11:35.516 --> 11:37.885
Oh, God bless you.

11:38.452 --> 11:39.454
Mmm.

11:41.154 --> 11:42.823
Mmm.

11:42.823 --> 11:44.825
What a delicious beverage.

11:44.825 --> 11:46.294
You may now tell me
what happened today.

11:46.294 --> 11:48.029
Wait, before you guys
get into that,

11:48.029 --> 11:49.264
I'm gonna go take a leak

11:49.264 --> 11:50.665
while you two
sync your periods.

11:50.665 --> 11:51.727
Mmm! Nailed it.

11:51.727 --> 11:53.234
- Dumb.
- Stupid.

11:53.234 --> 11:54.902
Ah.
- Really stupid.

11:58.232 --> 12:00.141
So, um...

12:00.141 --> 12:02.843
I got called
into Stu's office today.

12:02.843 --> 12:05.546
Did you get fired?

12:05.546 --> 12:07.983
No, I kind of got a promotion.

12:08.982 --> 12:11.152
Jane that is so awesome.

12:11.152 --> 12:13.154
They want to transfer me
to London.

12:14.621 --> 12:16.391
Wait, what?

12:16.391 --> 12:19.194
He wants me
to start up an office

12:19.893 --> 12:21.096
in London.

12:22.495 --> 12:24.232
What did you say?

12:24.232 --> 12:26.834
I said yes.

12:28.067 --> 12:29.670
Wow, that's great.

12:29.670 --> 12:31.806
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.042
Crazy, right?

12:34.042 --> 12:37.012
When... When?
When does this happen?

12:37.012 --> 12:38.346
Well, not for,
like, six months.

12:38.346 --> 12:41.116
So, it's not like tomorrow
or anything.

12:41.116 --> 12:43.684
Awesome. That's so awesome!

12:43.684 --> 12:45.320
This is so awesome.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.488
Wow. Awesome.

12:47.488 --> 12:49.090
You really deserve this.

12:49.090 --> 12:52.427
I just feel like, "Why not?"
You know?

12:52.427 --> 12:54.195
Like, I've never been
an adult there.

12:54.195 --> 12:55.964
I might like it.
I can take the tube to work.

12:55.964 --> 12:57.465
I've never taken the tube
to work.

12:57.465 --> 12:58.533
Yeah.

12:59.298 --> 13:00.468
What about Danny?

13:00.468 --> 13:01.702
Oh, he's in.

13:01.702 --> 13:03.138
I mean, what else
is he going to do?

13:03.138 --> 13:04.105
He said he could find
some nerdy music blog

13:04.105 --> 13:05.340
to write for over there.

13:05.340 --> 13:06.607
I mean, maybe London
will inspire him

13:06.607 --> 13:09.544
to fucking propose.

13:09.544 --> 13:12.847
You think you're gonna get
engaged while you're there?

13:12.847 --> 13:15.450
Well, I mean...

13:16.349 --> 13:17.452
No...

13:17.452 --> 13:18.920
He'll probably wait
another eight years.

13:18.920 --> 13:20.255
Mmm-hmm.

13:20.954 --> 13:21.889
What?

13:21.889 --> 13:23.758
I know it kinda sucks.

13:23.758 --> 13:25.460
I'm so happy for you.

13:26.292 --> 13:27.996
But...

13:27.996 --> 13:30.498
Well... it's gonna
be weird, isn't it?

13:30.498 --> 13:32.633
Not living five minutes
away from each other.

13:32.633 --> 13:35.403
Yeah, but I mean, it's...

13:35.403 --> 13:38.606
- That's... I'm busy, you know?
- Mmm-hmm.

13:38.606 --> 13:41.309
There's, like, all of the stuff
that's going real well,

13:41.309 --> 13:43.945
and all the other
really important things,

13:43.945 --> 13:45.947
and the kids
are almost in college, so...

13:45.947 --> 13:48.383
Uh, how many kids
do you have again?

13:48.383 --> 13:49.951
I have 12 kids.

13:49.951 --> 13:51.953
What are their names again?

13:52.753 --> 13:55.890
They're all named Denise.

13:55.890 --> 13:58.493
- That's right.

13:58.493 --> 13:59.760
Well, honestly, Lucy,

13:59.760 --> 14:01.829
this might be
really good for you.

14:01.829 --> 14:04.232
Start painting again.
Sell some shit.

14:04.232 --> 14:05.900
I won't be here
to distract you.

14:05.900 --> 14:08.369
Yeah, totally. Everything...
Jane.

14:08.369 --> 14:11.072
Everything is gonna be fine, okay?

14:11.072 --> 14:13.341
You're gonna be fine.
I'm fine.

14:15.110 --> 14:17.979
You promise you're gonna
come back all the time?

14:17.979 --> 14:19.948
Yes, of course.

14:21.816 --> 14:23.484
But do you know when?

14:24.484 --> 14:25.921
Like, what dates?

14:25.921 --> 14:27.555
I don't know exactly,
but often.

14:27.988 --> 14:29.524
Cool.

14:30.926 --> 14:32.360
Do you wipe front to back?

14:32.360 --> 14:34.562
Yeah, you have
to wipe front to back.

14:34.562 --> 14:36.064
Yeah, but some people
wipe all the way

14:36.064 --> 14:37.465
in one motion
from front to back.

14:37.465 --> 14:40.235
No, I do two in the front
and one in the back.

14:40.235 --> 14:42.898
- Yeah.
- Tap-tap one. One tap two.

14:42.898 --> 14:44.672
Yeah, that's what I do.

14:44.672 --> 14:46.874
That's why...

14:46.874 --> 14:49.177
that's why
we're best friends, Jane!

14:49.177 --> 14:51.746
That's why, because...

14:51.746 --> 14:53.381
Lucy...

14:53.381 --> 14:56.017
Because we even wipe
the same way!

14:56.017 --> 14:58.786
And now we won't even be
wiping in the same...

14:59.787 --> 15:01.356
- ...country!
- Okay.

15:02.555 --> 15:06.127
- Let... let's wash our hands.

15:07.789 --> 15:09.630
I love you.

15:11.364 --> 15:13.234
Okay, I have a confession.

15:13.234 --> 15:14.931
Sometimes I blow my nose
in my shirt

15:14.931 --> 15:16.371
when I'm working out.

15:16.371 --> 15:19.540
Oh, okay, well,
some of those are my shirts!

15:19.540 --> 15:21.376
I have a little confession
to make.

15:21.376 --> 15:23.378
- Okay.

15:23.378 --> 15:26.081
Sometimes I go pee
in the shower.

15:26.081 --> 15:27.415
Everyone pees in the shower!

15:27.415 --> 15:29.084
- Talk about...
- That's not a good one.

15:29.084 --> 15:31.119
- I have a confession.
- Oh, really?

15:31.119 --> 15:33.554
I kissed Amanda Newman
in tenth grade.

15:33.554 --> 15:34.789
- Okay!
- Yeah.

15:34.789 --> 15:36.191
Thousand points
for that confession.

15:36.191 --> 15:37.492
Uh-huh.
Wow.

15:37.492 --> 15:38.955
Wait, what?
You never told me that.

15:38.955 --> 15:41.196
Yeah. Tenth grade,
behind 7-Eleven.

15:41.196 --> 15:42.763
She dared me to do it
and I did it.

15:42.763 --> 15:44.332
How could you not
tell me that?

15:44.332 --> 15:46.467
That's a big girl
if you kissed a deal.

15:46.467 --> 15:48.103
Mmm?
What?

15:48.103 --> 15:50.338
I mean, it's a big kiss
if you dealt a girl.

15:50.338 --> 15:51.706
I mean...

15:51.706 --> 15:53.841
- The third way to say that.

15:53.841 --> 15:55.910
Why don't you
take a little sip of that water
right there, honey?

15:55.910 --> 15:57.645
There you go. Good job.

15:57.645 --> 16:00.115
- Yo, was she a good kisser?

16:00.115 --> 16:01.582
- She was pretty good.
- Mmm-hmm?

16:01.582 --> 16:03.118
Yeah. She was.

16:03.118 --> 16:05.886
You never even said
this to me before, these words.

16:05.886 --> 16:07.155
I never heard them.

16:07.155 --> 16:09.290
Have you ever kissed
a girl before?

16:10.090 --> 16:11.292
No.

16:11.292 --> 16:13.028
Well, if you were
to kiss a girl...

16:13.028 --> 16:14.229
Mmm-hmm.
- ...who would it be?

16:14.229 --> 16:16.831
- Who would you kiss?
- Brittany.

16:16.831 --> 16:18.699
Brittany? That's interesting.

16:18.699 --> 16:20.035
- Why is it... Who is...
- Yeah. Yeah.

16:20.035 --> 16:21.369
Who is... Who's Brit-Brit?

16:21.369 --> 16:23.638
She's who does the massages
at my job.

16:23.638 --> 16:26.341
- Is she, uh, gay or straight?
- She's just... I don't know.

16:26.341 --> 16:28.476
Maybe she's straight.
She wears dresses.

16:28.476 --> 16:31.312
Oh, you... Okay. You know
lesbians wear dresses, right?

16:31.312 --> 16:33.181
She said she loved you today.

16:33.181 --> 16:38.053
She is very, very flirty.
She likes to touch me.

16:38.053 --> 16:39.854
Do you know
what she calls her? Luce.

16:39.854 --> 16:42.018
Mmm.
And she's just
started working there.

16:42.018 --> 16:43.791
You should do it.

16:43.791 --> 16:46.894
It is not a good idea to
make out with your coworkers,
you guys.

16:46.894 --> 16:48.096
Read the news.

16:48.096 --> 16:49.931
Right. I'm going to bed.

16:49.931 --> 16:51.299
You always do that
so abruptly.

16:51.299 --> 16:52.767
I know when it's time.

16:52.767 --> 16:54.502
Can we have a sleepover?

16:54.502 --> 16:56.271
I don't... Mmm...

16:56.271 --> 16:59.707
You better come
and visit me.

16:59.707 --> 17:01.542
Yeah, I'll bring you
that sandwich

17:01.542 --> 17:06.114
that you really love from that
shitty place on Sunset.

17:06.114 --> 17:08.616
Thank you.

17:08.616 --> 17:10.885
I'll put it in a cooler.

17:10.885 --> 17:14.722
It'll stay good on the plane
for 11 hours, right?

17:14.722 --> 17:16.052
For sure.

17:23.864 --> 17:25.466
Are you crying?

17:26.566 --> 17:30.171
No.
- Lucy...

17:30.171 --> 17:33.408
I promise it's not
gonna be that different.

17:38.545 --> 17:41.616
- Don't cry.

17:44.050 --> 17:47.255
We can FaceTime and talk
just like always.

17:49.290 --> 17:53.261
Whoa. What's going on?

17:55.028 --> 17:56.397
Lucy...

18:02.770 --> 18:06.007
You know, when I said
that I would
make out with Brittany...

18:06.007 --> 18:07.342
Yes?

18:08.909 --> 18:10.245
I really would.

18:10.245 --> 18:12.347
I didn't think you were
lying about that.

18:12.347 --> 18:14.315
But, like...

18:17.083 --> 18:18.486
I really would.

18:22.923 --> 18:26.327
Like... Like, really?

18:28.261 --> 18:30.798
Yeah, I think so.

18:30.798 --> 18:34.635
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you say anything?

18:34.635 --> 18:37.872
I just felt easier
to keep it buried inside.

18:37.872 --> 18:41.276
Fuck, Lucy.
You can't keep this inside.

18:41.276 --> 18:42.910
- You'll explode.

18:42.910 --> 18:44.245
I hate this.

18:50.850 --> 18:53.654
Have you talked
to anyone about this?

18:55.588 --> 18:57.825
How long
have you felt this way?

18:59.059 --> 19:00.361
A while.

19:00.361 --> 19:02.797
And you never acted on it?

19:02.797 --> 19:04.865
Like, not even in secret?

19:05.966 --> 19:07.235
Oh!

19:08.135 --> 19:09.837
I feel so stupid.

19:11.771 --> 19:16.511
Like... [sighs] I should have
figured this out by now.

19:16.511 --> 19:18.213
You can't look at it that way.

19:18.213 --> 19:21.582
Yes, I can, Jane.
I'm 32 years old.

19:21.582 --> 19:24.885
There's no timeline
to figuring it out.

19:24.885 --> 19:27.288
People figure this out
when they're, like, nine.

19:27.721 --> 19:29.090
Nine?

19:29.090 --> 19:31.526
When I was nine,
I pretended I was a puppy

19:31.526 --> 19:33.561
and I would only bark
at people.

19:33.561 --> 19:37.765
Yeah, that sounds strange
to say it out loud.

19:37.765 --> 19:39.800
I feel so stupid.

19:39.800 --> 19:43.438
And I don't even
know what I am.

19:43.438 --> 19:47.308
I don't even know if I'm...
if I'm really that way,

19:47.308 --> 19:49.744
and I'm just afraid
to admit it,

19:49.744 --> 19:52.113
or if I'm not, and I just...
What?

19:52.113 --> 19:55.883
I don't ever, like, date boys.

19:55.883 --> 19:57.919
I mean, men. I don't know.

19:57.919 --> 19:59.520
Well, maybe you're both.

20:05.458 --> 20:10.031
No. I just should've
figured it out.

20:10.031 --> 20:14.669
When you kissed Amanda Newman,
did you like it?

20:14.669 --> 20:20.408
Oh, God, I guess. I had
a Zima. I thought I was drunk.

20:20.408 --> 20:24.345
But you weren't like,
"Maybe I'm gay?"

20:24.345 --> 20:26.581
I don't know.
I wasn't gonna, like,

20:26.581 --> 20:28.683
be with Amanda Newman.

20:28.683 --> 20:30.718
- Why? Why not?
- 'Cause...

20:30.718 --> 20:33.354
Well, it was just a dumb kiss.

20:35.120 --> 20:38.559
So, when you kiss Danny,
are you thinking, like,

20:38.559 --> 20:40.895
"I'm so straight.
I love dudes?"

20:40.895 --> 20:44.966
Usually, I'm like,
"Brush your teeth.
I can taste Subway."

20:45.899 --> 20:47.768
Seriously.

20:47.768 --> 20:50.939
I don't know
if it's so simple, Lucy.

20:50.939 --> 20:54.075
How have you felt
sleeping with guys?

20:54.075 --> 20:55.443
Weird.

20:55.443 --> 20:57.378
Weird like you think
everything is weird

20:57.378 --> 21:00.115
or weird
like you just didn't like it?

21:00.115 --> 21:04.452
Weird like
that must be the reason
I've barely done it.

21:06.953 --> 21:09.890
Did you think that I was?

21:09.890 --> 21:11.726
A vagina lover?

21:11.726 --> 21:14.963
- It crossed my mind.

21:14.963 --> 21:16.764
I'm not. I don't... I...

21:16.764 --> 21:18.699
I don't love vaginas.
I'm not--

21:18.699 --> 21:21.536
You did own
a Volvo in high school.

21:21.536 --> 21:24.039
- You did.
- Jane, Volvos are

21:24.039 --> 21:26.607
- the safest car.
- Okay.

21:27.542 --> 21:30.578
Shit, Lucy, I'm sorry. I'm...

21:30.578 --> 21:32.347
I'm mad I never brought it up

21:32.347 --> 21:35.250
if it was hurting you
this much.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.617
It's okay.

21:39.419 --> 21:41.990
I probably would have
just lied anyway.

21:41.990 --> 21:44.125
Well, now we know.

21:44.125 --> 21:48.324
And now, we've got to get you
to make out with Brit-Brit.

21:48.324 --> 21:50.431
I don't even know
if she likes girls.

21:50.431 --> 21:53.101
Well, then we'll find you
some girls who do.

21:53.101 --> 21:57.672
Lucy, from what I understand,
and I believe this to be true,

21:57.672 --> 21:59.774
all lesbians know each other.

21:59.774 --> 22:01.809
They've all slept
with each other.

22:01.809 --> 22:03.979
So, for you to enter
into the fray,

22:03.979 --> 22:07.115
you're gonna be the star
of the lesbian community.

22:07.115 --> 22:08.249
I don't like that word.

22:08.249 --> 22:10.986
I know. "Community."

22:17.123 --> 22:18.960
I'm scared.

22:18.960 --> 22:20.628
Of course it's scary.

22:21.994 --> 22:25.000
But you think a lot of things
are scary.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.267
You still scared of how

22:26.267 --> 22:28.069
Salt-N-Pepa whisper
in <i>Push It?</i>

22:28.069 --> 22:29.637
Yes. Very.

22:29.637 --> 22:33.274
Look, I'd be scared to touch
someone else's vagina.

22:35.476 --> 22:38.079
But I'm not leaving
this country till you do.

22:45.320 --> 22:48.723
- I love you.
- I love you.

22:54.793 --> 22:58.299
Luce, you okay? What's wrong?

22:58.299 --> 23:01.569
Oh, yeah,
I just had too much tequila.

23:01.569 --> 23:03.704
Oh, give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

23:03.704 --> 23:06.307
I know a cure
for a hangover headache.

23:06.307 --> 23:08.309
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

23:08.309 --> 23:09.544
What'd you do last night?

23:09.544 --> 23:12.013
- Did you have a hot date?
- Mmm, no.

23:12.013 --> 23:15.550
Uh, Jane told me
she's moving to London,

23:15.550 --> 23:18.153
so I got shit-faced.

23:18.153 --> 23:20.989
Oh, Luce, I'm sorry,

23:20.989 --> 23:24.059
but, um, I mean, that...
that...

23:24.059 --> 23:25.360
Well, it sucks.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.662
It's fine. It's okay. Um...

23:27.662 --> 23:30.698
Probably not helping
my headache.

23:33.866 --> 23:36.804
- Is that too much?
- No, it's so nice.

23:36.804 --> 23:39.074
Well, we can hang out more.

23:40.373 --> 23:42.277
Unless you...

23:42.277 --> 23:43.378
- Oh, no.
- ...don't want to.

23:43.378 --> 23:45.546
No, no.
I'd love to.

23:45.546 --> 23:48.149
Okay, good.

23:48.149 --> 23:49.884
Because I'm a lot of fun.

23:51.484 --> 23:52.687
More later?

24:10.436 --> 24:11.639
No.

24:42.137 --> 24:43.604
Have you ever fucked
an Uber driver?

24:43.604 --> 24:44.905
- No.
- That's so something

24:44.905 --> 24:46.374
- Drew would do.

24:46.374 --> 24:47.642
You know Drew.

24:47.642 --> 24:49.110
Which one's Drew?

24:49.110 --> 24:50.278
I've talked about him.

24:50.278 --> 24:51.612
He's the one who only talks
on speakerphone.

24:51.612 --> 24:53.214
He's the fucking worst.

24:53.214 --> 24:55.550
- I'd still fuck him, though.

24:55.550 --> 24:56.817
Maybe I should try to do that

24:56.817 --> 24:58.619
- before we leave for London.
- Mmm.

24:58.619 --> 25:00.188
Oh, you're gonna
go to London, too?

25:00.188 --> 25:03.519
- Yeah, I told you that.
- Mmm-mmm. No, you didn't.

25:03.519 --> 25:05.726
I can't wait to go
and be on Jane's team!

25:05.726 --> 25:07.295
I'm so excited! Girls.

25:07.295 --> 25:10.665
Say Vegemite! "Vegemite."

25:10.665 --> 25:11.933
That's Australian.

25:11.933 --> 25:13.668
Love It. Storying it.
Posting it.

25:14.967 --> 25:16.938
I'm fully going bi
when I go to London.

25:16.938 --> 25:19.574
The girls are
so fucking hot there.

25:19.574 --> 25:21.376
Wait. Are you, uh,
seeing anyone?

25:21.376 --> 25:23.078
Uh, no, not right now.

25:23.078 --> 25:24.980
Did you guys know I've only
been with seven people?

25:24.980 --> 25:26.747
Really?
- Isn't that crazy?

25:26.747 --> 25:29.484
My number's nine,
including Danny.
And I feel like...

25:29.484 --> 25:30.818
Danny needs
to let you get to ten.

25:30.818 --> 25:32.653
- Right?
- He needs to.

25:32.653 --> 25:34.222
How many people
have you slept with?

25:35.121 --> 25:36.524
Um...

25:36.524 --> 25:37.825
- Um...
Too many to count?

25:37.825 --> 25:40.595
- No, no, no. I--
- I wish I was like you,

25:40.595 --> 25:42.297
but we have the same hair,
so I'm on my way.

25:43.731 --> 25:45.200
I love this shirt!

25:45.200 --> 25:46.562
- Oh, really?
- Mmm-hmm.

25:46.562 --> 25:48.069
- Thanks.
- Where'd you get it?

25:48.069 --> 25:49.737
It's probably from the Gap.
Is it from the Gap?

25:49.737 --> 25:51.272
Aw, the Gap.

25:51.272 --> 25:52.974
Um, actually, I think it is.

25:52.974 --> 25:54.609
Aw, the Gap.

25:56.677 --> 25:58.613
- J? J?
- Hmm?

25:58.613 --> 26:00.081
You have something
in your teeth.

26:00.081 --> 26:02.017
- Oh. Thank you.
Perfect. You got it.

26:02.017 --> 26:04.485
I always tell people when they
have something in their teeth.

26:04.485 --> 26:06.054
I think it's like
the most important thing

26:06.054 --> 26:07.688
- you can do for a friend.
- I totally agree.

26:07.688 --> 26:09.357
I think it's so important.

26:09.357 --> 26:11.927
I mean, it's not like the most
important thing you can do.

26:11.927 --> 26:13.728
I, like... I didn't see it.

26:13.728 --> 26:16.097
I would have said something
if I saw it, J.

26:16.097 --> 26:18.033
<i>♪ Will you come visit us? ♪</i>

26:18.033 --> 26:20.101
<i>♪ Will you come to London? ♪</i>

26:20.101 --> 26:21.202
Will you come?

26:21.202 --> 26:23.599
Well, yeah, I hope so.
We'll see.

26:23.599 --> 26:25.840
Wait, guys.
I have a friend from college

26:25.840 --> 26:27.142
who knows a bunch
of the royals.

26:27.142 --> 26:28.376
We should follow them
on Instagram.

26:28.376 --> 26:29.877
Jane hates Instagram.

26:29.877 --> 26:32.447
I don't hate it.
I just don't go on it a ton.

26:32.447 --> 26:34.983
Well, I hope you like big,
random dinner parties.

26:34.983 --> 26:36.985
- Yeah, I love!
- What?

26:36.985 --> 26:38.753
You absolutely
hate dinner parties.

26:38.753 --> 26:41.256
This is different.
When you're abroad,
it's different.

26:41.256 --> 26:43.158
When you're abroad,
everything's different.

26:43.158 --> 26:45.660
Everything is different
when you're abroad.

26:45.660 --> 26:47.762
I can't wait
to meet Jane's family!

26:49.395 --> 26:51.732
Isn't Kat the best?
She's the best.

26:51.732 --> 26:53.034
You hate her.

26:53.034 --> 26:55.536
I don't hate her,
but she's just a lot.

26:55.536 --> 26:57.072
Yeah, but I like it.

26:57.072 --> 26:59.174
You gals are gonna have fun
in London, aren't you?

26:59.174 --> 27:02.510
Oh, I almost forgot.
I got muffins.

27:02.510 --> 27:04.345
Ooh!

27:05.478 --> 27:07.482
- Bluebs?
- A bluebs and a bran.

27:07.482 --> 27:10.885
We each have half of one now
and half when we're done.

27:10.885 --> 27:12.520
I can't have a whole one now?

27:12.520 --> 27:14.122
No, half and half.

27:14.122 --> 27:15.590
And then we have a snack
waiting for us
when we're done.

27:15.590 --> 27:16.757
It's the smart way to do it.

27:16.757 --> 27:18.293
It's the controlling way
to do it.

27:18.293 --> 27:20.495
I'm the thoughtful one
who bought muffins.

27:20.495 --> 27:22.630
Which one do you want?

27:22.630 --> 27:24.165
Bran or bluebs?

27:24.165 --> 27:25.433
Bran, obviously.

27:25.433 --> 27:27.302
End with the bluebs.

27:29.402 --> 27:31.239
I guess I'll have bran.

27:31.239 --> 27:33.141
We need to figure out
your type.

27:33.141 --> 27:34.409
No, no.

27:34.409 --> 27:36.044
Why does she touch me so much?

27:36.044 --> 27:37.979
- You mean Brit-Brit?
- Yeah.

27:37.979 --> 27:40.648
'Cause she wants
to have sex with you.

27:40.648 --> 27:43.651
It's like way more
than normal.

27:43.651 --> 27:44.852
Look, here's the bottom line.

27:44.852 --> 27:45.987
You can use this chick

27:45.987 --> 27:47.322
- as a sexual portal.
- Why?

27:47.322 --> 27:48.990
But this isn't
a lasting relationship.

27:48.990 --> 27:50.291
Touch her stuff, roll around.

27:50.291 --> 27:51.759
Then we've got to get you
on those apps

27:51.759 --> 27:52.961
so people know their way
around your area.

27:52.961 --> 27:54.495
I do not want to do that.

27:54.495 --> 27:56.131
Can I ask you something?

27:56.131 --> 27:59.467
Why don't you think you have
to date like everyone else?

27:59.467 --> 28:01.202
No one's gonna ring
on your doorbell one day,

28:01.202 --> 28:02.670
looking for
a wishy-washy lesbian

28:02.670 --> 28:04.039
who might want
to try some stuff.

28:04.039 --> 28:06.207
- You don't know that for sure.

28:06.207 --> 28:08.476
Come on, two at a time.
Squeeze your cheeks.

28:08.476 --> 28:10.911
- This is different.

28:10.911 --> 28:12.280
How is it different?

28:12.280 --> 28:14.849
Because, what if somebody
I know is on there

28:14.849 --> 28:16.952
and then they're like,
"What? She's gay?"

28:16.952 --> 28:19.687
- Then what?
- Then everybody knows.

28:19.687 --> 28:21.456
Great!

28:21.456 --> 28:22.823
It's not like people know you

28:22.823 --> 28:25.293
as this tried
and true heterosexual.

28:25.293 --> 28:28.763
You never let anyone
set you up,
you don't date.

28:28.763 --> 28:30.131
People will be like,

28:30.131 --> 28:32.333
"Oh, good.
She figured it out."

28:32.333 --> 28:34.035
Do you think
people are thinking that?

28:34.035 --> 28:35.470
I don't know!

28:35.470 --> 28:38.940
Everyone is just gonna
want you to be happy.

28:38.940 --> 28:41.342
What if I'm not meant
to be happy?

28:41.342 --> 28:43.178
Oh, my God.

28:43.178 --> 28:46.114
I'm running up there,
and I am not coming back down.

28:46.114 --> 28:47.148
Fine.

28:49.549 --> 28:51.452
- I'm sitting here.

28:51.452 --> 28:53.054
Have I ever been happy?

28:53.054 --> 28:55.523
I don't even know
what makes me happy.

28:55.523 --> 28:57.658
I'm nervous all the time.

28:57.658 --> 29:00.428
And I'm scared of everything.

29:00.428 --> 29:02.197
Lucy, these are
lame fucking excuses

29:02.197 --> 29:04.465
so you don't have to step
outside of your comfort zone.

29:04.465 --> 29:06.367
You're more than capable
of being happy.

29:06.367 --> 29:08.436
Don't spew
that bullshit at me.

29:08.436 --> 29:12.407
I'm being vulnerable right now
and you're attacking me.

29:12.407 --> 29:15.743
Squeeze. You're not
even comfortable
in your comfort zone.

29:15.743 --> 29:18.146
So, why not just
try something new?

29:18.146 --> 29:19.948
You try 20 different
flavors of ice cream

29:19.948 --> 29:22.717
before you settle on
a single scoop. Do that.

29:22.717 --> 29:25.686
Ice cream is different
than a vagina.

29:25.686 --> 29:27.522
How do you know?
You don't know.

29:27.522 --> 29:29.057
Yeah, I do know.

29:29.057 --> 29:32.227
Otherwise, it would be called
vagice cream.

29:34.828 --> 29:37.098
Am I okay?

29:37.098 --> 29:39.267
I don't want to be this thing
that's different.

29:39.267 --> 29:43.504
I don't want to have
to tell everybody
this big thing. It's...

29:43.504 --> 29:47.242
I know that it's fine,
and no one cares,
but I care,

29:48.341 --> 29:49.410
and I'm late.

29:49.410 --> 29:51.746
It's so late in life.

29:51.746 --> 29:54.916
Then don't waste
any more time.

29:54.916 --> 29:57.718
I just wish I didn't think
about her so much.

29:57.718 --> 29:59.287
You think about her a lot?

30:00.586 --> 30:04.759
Lucy, you're gonna be fine.

30:04.759 --> 30:08.229
Let's go to a gay bar one night
and have a look around.

30:08.229 --> 30:11.366
I'm sure there's a place
with some kind
of lesbian jamboree.

30:12.632 --> 30:14.302
The Womb.

30:14.302 --> 30:15.971
You know it's called the Womb.

30:15.971 --> 30:18.206
I've never been more
proud of you. We're going.

30:18.206 --> 30:20.408
No. I'm not ready for that.

30:20.408 --> 30:23.478
Please, it'll be fun.
It's research.

30:23.478 --> 30:26.014
Can I please have the other
half of my muffin now?

30:26.014 --> 30:27.415
And do you want to mention

30:27.415 --> 30:29.684
how much better it is
to end with bluebs?

30:29.684 --> 30:31.552
- Don't ignore me, Denise!

30:31.552 --> 30:35.851
You gotta start shaving
above da knees, Denise.

31:32.144 --> 31:35.083
- Hey, pretty. Whatcha doing?
Oh, um, just...

31:35.083 --> 31:37.718
I was just googling things.

31:37.718 --> 31:39.916
- Totally random.

31:39.916 --> 31:41.489
Just totally random stuff.

31:43.756 --> 31:46.094
Oh, Luce, you are so talented.

31:46.094 --> 31:47.395
- What?

31:47.395 --> 31:48.997
Like, what are you
even doing here?

31:50.098 --> 31:51.466
Good question.

31:51.466 --> 31:54.970
Actually, I paint.
That's what I like to do.

31:54.970 --> 31:56.933
Well, I want
to see your paintings.

31:56.933 --> 31:58.339
Oh...

31:58.339 --> 32:00.308
No. I mean,
I don't have any of them here.

32:00.308 --> 32:02.077
I didn't think
you had them with you.

32:02.077 --> 32:03.578
- Can you imagine?

32:03.578 --> 32:05.780
I just pull out, like,
12 from under the table.

32:07.515 --> 32:11.119
I wanna see your paintings
because I bet they're amazing.

32:11.119 --> 32:13.388
Yeah, maybe one day.

32:13.388 --> 32:14.951
Well, when are
we gonna hang out?

32:15.450 --> 32:16.391
Um...

32:16.956 --> 32:17.954
whenever.

32:17.954 --> 32:20.328
Okay. Tonight?

32:20.328 --> 32:23.198
Sure, I can do tonight.
I can make that work.

32:23.198 --> 32:26.434
Okay, well, I'll cook.

32:26.434 --> 32:28.669
- Squee! I'm so excited.

32:44.851 --> 32:46.054
Bitch.

32:49.222 --> 32:52.027
Oh, my God. All the time.

32:53.694 --> 32:55.196
- Really?
- Yes.

32:55.196 --> 32:58.299
Like, boner after boner
after sad little boner.

32:58.299 --> 32:59.534
Wow.

32:59.534 --> 33:01.502
Do they ever ask you
to, like...

33:02.869 --> 33:04.239
diddle them?

33:04.239 --> 33:05.941
- Some.

33:05.941 --> 33:07.003
I've diddled.

33:07.003 --> 33:08.843
I diddled. One time.

33:08.843 --> 33:10.545
- You did?
Yes.

33:10.545 --> 33:13.081
I mean,
I had to try it at some point.

33:13.081 --> 33:14.815
And he was cute.
So, it was fine.

33:14.815 --> 33:16.918
Wow. Did he tip you?

33:16.918 --> 33:18.219
Oh, fuck, yeah.

33:18.219 --> 33:20.188
But that was it.
That was all I did.

33:20.188 --> 33:21.589
That's why I'm saying.
Like, really,

33:21.589 --> 33:24.926
I wanna open
a female-only studio.

33:24.926 --> 33:27.963
They're just...
They're better.

33:27.963 --> 33:29.364
I bet not so many hairy backs.

33:29.364 --> 33:32.867
You'd be surprised.

33:32.867 --> 33:34.469
No, they're, um...

33:35.335 --> 33:36.704
They're much softer.

33:39.467 --> 33:42.310
Oh, my God!

33:42.310 --> 33:44.445
What's your
longest relationship?

33:45.444 --> 33:49.317
I don't know. Not long.

33:49.317 --> 33:52.453
Like, months.
A couple of months.

33:53.319 --> 33:54.855
Have you ever been in love?

33:54.855 --> 33:56.191
Mmm!

33:57.357 --> 33:59.494
- Really?
- No.

33:59.494 --> 34:03.598
Oh, I'm kinda jealous.
Like, you have something great

34:03.598 --> 34:04.899
to look forward to.

34:04.899 --> 34:07.302
- Have you?
- Oh, yeah.

34:07.302 --> 34:09.637
My college boyfriend.

34:09.637 --> 34:12.440
I was obsessed with him,
and I thought that, like,

34:12.440 --> 34:14.742
if he broke up with me,
I would die.

34:14.742 --> 34:16.577
Like, literally die.

34:16.577 --> 34:17.812
What happened?

34:17.812 --> 34:20.448
He moved to Portland,
then he broke up with me.

34:20.448 --> 34:23.284
And then I didn't die, so...

34:23.284 --> 34:25.081
- Cheers to that.

34:25.081 --> 34:26.587
And then I realized

34:26.587 --> 34:29.724
that I should probably
have sex with more people.

34:29.724 --> 34:30.791
So...

34:32.092 --> 34:33.694
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

34:33.694 --> 34:34.862
Do you miss him?

34:34.862 --> 34:36.932
Mmm... No.

34:36.932 --> 34:39.367
I mean, I see him sometimes.

34:39.367 --> 34:41.469
I feel like he's a weirdo.

34:41.469 --> 34:44.872
And I think
that he's gay, so...

34:44.872 --> 34:46.207
Really?

34:47.107 --> 34:48.909
I don't know.

34:48.909 --> 34:51.279
It's a spectrum, right?

34:51.279 --> 34:55.216
Gay, straight, bi.
What does it even all mean?

34:55.216 --> 34:56.651
I think in that case,

34:56.651 --> 34:59.220
it means you're
either gay, straight or bi.

34:59.220 --> 35:02.118
You're funny.

35:02.118 --> 35:03.891
- You're funny.

35:05.925 --> 35:10.198
I mean, I think everyone falls
somewhere on the spectrum.

35:10.198 --> 35:12.600
Like, I know
I'm on the spectrum.

35:12.600 --> 35:15.570
You're on the spectrum,
don't you think?

35:17.037 --> 35:19.574
- Probably.
- Hmm. Love is love.

35:24.412 --> 35:26.281
Have you ever made out
with a girl?

35:30.283 --> 35:32.087
You haven't?

35:32.087 --> 35:33.888
- No.
- What?

35:33.888 --> 35:34.956
Why do you say that?

35:34.956 --> 35:38.493
No, I just, like... I assumed.

35:38.493 --> 35:41.062
Because you're a woman
with the times.

35:41.062 --> 35:42.697
- What?

35:42.697 --> 35:44.332
What does that mean?

35:44.332 --> 35:46.201
I don't know.
I just feel like...

35:46.201 --> 35:48.569
everyone should try it
at some point.

35:49.869 --> 35:50.871
Have you?

35:51.605 --> 35:52.607
No.

35:53.840 --> 35:54.909
Not yet.

36:01.347 --> 36:02.750
Show me one of your paintings.

36:04.718 --> 36:05.753
Um...

36:05.753 --> 36:07.822
And then I'll leave after.
I promise.

36:07.822 --> 36:09.157
You don't have to go.

36:09.157 --> 36:10.158
Uh, I mean,
you don't have to do that.

36:10.158 --> 36:11.892
Okay.

36:11.892 --> 36:13.661
- Just one.
- Fine.

36:18.165 --> 36:20.068
- There's...
- Ooh.

36:20.068 --> 36:22.903
This is so cool.

36:23.603 --> 36:25.506
I love that you paint.

36:26.039 --> 36:28.309
Oh, my God.

36:28.309 --> 36:30.311
- Lucy.

36:30.311 --> 36:32.080
They're old.
They're really old.

36:32.080 --> 36:34.282
I haven't painted
in a long time.

36:34.282 --> 36:36.417
This is what
you should be doing.

36:37.617 --> 36:39.354
- I don't know.

36:44.423 --> 36:45.793
I should go.

36:51.331 --> 36:52.633
This was fun.

36:52.633 --> 36:54.869
Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?

36:54.869 --> 36:56.704
Um, we should do it more.

36:56.704 --> 36:58.806
Totally. Yeah.
- Yeah.

37:05.812 --> 37:06.948
Good night.

37:06.948 --> 37:08.283
Night-night.

37:19.492 --> 37:21.896
"Night-night?"
What?

37:21.896 --> 37:27.168
When you let go and start
to embrace who you really are,

37:27.168 --> 37:29.470
that's when you start
to open up

37:29.470 --> 37:33.074
your hearts and your bodies.

37:33.074 --> 37:35.810
- Today, I want you to remember

37:35.810 --> 37:39.380
to lead with hope
and not with fear.

37:39.380 --> 37:41.416
Fear only holds you back.

37:41.416 --> 37:43.551
I don't know.
I didn't ask her to stay.

37:43.551 --> 37:46.387
Maybe I should have.

37:46.387 --> 37:48.856
I don't like this.
You have shaky voice.

37:48.856 --> 37:49.958
No, I don't.

37:49.958 --> 37:52.093
- Yes, you do.
- God, it's just weird.

37:52.093 --> 37:55.030
It's all... weird.

37:55.030 --> 37:57.332
I'm weird. I hate this.

37:57.332 --> 37:58.766
How close was the kiss?

37:59.299 --> 38:00.435
Like, close.

38:00.435 --> 38:02.203
Show me where?

38:02.203 --> 38:04.105
Like, here.

38:04.105 --> 38:06.007
That's pretty close.

38:06.007 --> 38:08.076
I don't know about this bitch.
If she's fucking with you,

38:08.076 --> 38:09.344
I'll fuck her shit up.

38:09.344 --> 38:11.112
Do you think she's gay?

38:11.112 --> 38:13.648
I have no idea.

38:13.648 --> 38:15.616
But, like,
if you had to guess...

38:15.616 --> 38:16.985
I mean, I've never kissed

38:16.985 --> 38:19.487
a platonic girlfriend
on a mouth corner.

38:22.090 --> 38:24.993
She said
women have soft backs.

38:24.993 --> 38:28.263
Ew. Jesus. What?
And you drank white wine?

38:28.263 --> 38:30.465
Lucy, I'm genuinely alarmed.

38:31.631 --> 38:33.768
Maybe she's more confused
than I am.

38:33.768 --> 38:34.769
Maybe.

38:34.769 --> 38:36.704
But you need someone
who knows.

38:36.704 --> 38:38.073
Two people trying to figure out
if they're lesbians together,

38:38.073 --> 38:39.740
that might be the worst idea
I've ever heard.

38:39.740 --> 38:41.142
That's why we're going
to the Womb.

38:41.142 --> 38:42.377
- No.
- Yes.

38:42.377 --> 38:43.644
- I don't want to.
- We're finding you

38:43.644 --> 38:44.946
- a girlfriend before I leave.
- Please.

38:59.326 --> 39:00.929
<i>♪ Heart to break... ♪</i>

39:03.163 --> 39:04.765
I'd make a great lesbian.

39:04.765 --> 39:06.901
That's the real shame
in all of this.

39:06.901 --> 39:08.103
How are you doing?

39:08.103 --> 39:10.605
Good. Great.

39:10.605 --> 39:13.408
This girl's cute. She's cute.
She's cute, she's cute.

39:14.475 --> 39:15.410
Hi.

39:15.410 --> 39:16.811
I'm Jane. This is Lucy.

39:17.711 --> 39:20.376
Hi.

39:20.376 --> 39:22.283
Do you wanna come
dance with me?

39:22.283 --> 39:24.319
Um, I...

39:24.319 --> 39:26.487
I don't... I, uh...

39:26.487 --> 39:29.657
I, um... I have a drink.
I'm drinking it.

39:29.657 --> 39:32.627
- So, um...
- Okay.

39:33.593 --> 39:35.163
- Go with her.
- What?

39:35.163 --> 39:36.697
Why did you do that to me?

39:36.697 --> 39:40.468
Oh, my God!
Because you never do anything.

39:40.468 --> 39:42.770

He sounds
so fucking hot.

40:51.106 --> 40:52.773
<i>Uh, there were a few...</i>

41:04.051 --> 41:05.420
<i>- ...and there are...</i>
Yeah.

41:05.420 --> 41:06.821
<i>...some responsibilities</i>

41:06.821 --> 41:08.289

the flagpole</i>

41:08.289 --> 41:09.757

in your lap.</i>

41:09.757 --> 41:11.487
Yeah, we can have that
by tomorrow.

41:15.528 --> 41:16.965
<i>...they want us
to focus on it.</i>

41:16.965 --> 41:18.494
<i>So, I'm just giving you
a heads-up for that.</i>

41:18.494 --> 41:20.201
Uh-huh!

41:36.081 --> 41:37.986
<i>...we can
tie up together.</i>

41:37.986 --> 41:39.654
<i>I don't think they need to be
as dispersed as they are.</i>

41:39.654 --> 41:40.888
<i>But that's just
the best practice.</i>

41:40.888 --> 41:42.757
- Uh-huh.
<i>- You know?</i>

41:45.626 --> 41:47.362
Whatcha doin'?

41:47.362 --> 41:49.164
Oh, nothing. I'm just...

41:49.164 --> 41:52.767
Dumb online shopping.

41:52.767 --> 41:54.269
That one's kinda cute.

41:55.802 --> 41:58.473
Oh, I'm not really a...

41:58.473 --> 42:00.775
hole in the shoulders
kind of girl.

42:00.775 --> 42:02.043
Well, you only need

42:02.043 --> 42:04.012
one good shoulder
for that shirt.

42:04.012 --> 42:06.147
- And you have two.
- Oh?

42:06.147 --> 42:09.150
- Mmm-hmm.
- Thanks.

42:09.150 --> 42:11.219
I just had the best idea.

42:11.219 --> 42:14.522
- Does it involve my shoulders?
- Yeah, it does.

42:14.522 --> 42:16.291
We should have a try-on party.

42:16.291 --> 42:17.858
What's a try-on party?

42:17.858 --> 42:22.558
Like, try-on-my-clothes party.

42:22.558 --> 42:23.698
I love fashion.

42:23.698 --> 42:25.133
I should've been a stylist.

42:25.133 --> 42:27.168
Whatever. That's not even
what we're talking about.

42:27.168 --> 42:28.269
We'll have some wine.

42:28.269 --> 42:30.138
You try on my clothes
that I never wear

42:30.138 --> 42:33.074
and if you like them,
you can keep them.

42:33.074 --> 42:35.310
- Did you just make that up?
- Mmm-mmm.

42:35.310 --> 42:37.312
Everybody has try-on parties.

42:37.312 --> 42:40.015
Really? I...
I don't think that's true.

42:40.015 --> 42:40.982
It is true!

42:40.982 --> 42:42.750
Doesn't it sound fun, though?

42:42.750 --> 42:44.852
Do you have a lot of pants?

42:44.852 --> 42:46.254
Lucy, this is like a...

42:46.254 --> 42:49.490
No. It's like you need
more colors and pattern.

42:49.490 --> 42:51.692
Introduce new things
to your life.

42:53.426 --> 42:54.895
<i>And you CC'd me on that?</i>

42:54.895 --> 42:56.364
- Yeah.
- Okay.

42:57.564 --> 42:59.500
Hi. They didn't have
any, um...

42:59.500 --> 43:01.769
Hi!

43:01.769 --> 43:03.904
- Oh, it's so good to see you!
Hi.

43:03.904 --> 43:05.941
I love this jacket.

43:05.941 --> 43:09.377
Thanks. Thank you.
I love your dress?

43:09.377 --> 43:11.646
- I designed it.
- No way.

43:11.646 --> 43:12.914
- Yeah.
- That's so nice.

43:12.914 --> 43:14.115
- How are you?
- I'm good.

43:14.115 --> 43:15.583
- How are you?
- I'm so good.

43:15.583 --> 43:18.086
I'm so excited for my girl.

43:18.086 --> 43:19.615
Get your food and eat with us.

43:19.615 --> 43:20.888
Oh, no, no. You guys go do

43:20.888 --> 43:23.724
your cute little thing.

43:26.993 --> 43:28.863
I can't believe you just
asked her to eat with us.

43:28.863 --> 43:31.032
Oh, stop. I knew she wouldn't.

43:31.032 --> 43:32.533
Well, I'm sure
she'd love to be

43:32.533 --> 43:35.870
in the middle of our little
"cute little thing."

43:35.870 --> 43:37.605
I have so much shit
to get through.

43:37.605 --> 43:40.008
They just asked
if I could leave earlier.

43:40.008 --> 43:42.843
- I'm not going to.
- Good.

43:42.843 --> 43:45.413
Can they send Kat?
Like, today?

43:45.413 --> 43:46.642
I'll go pack her things.

43:46.642 --> 43:49.084
All right.
Enough with that already.

43:49.084 --> 43:51.786
All right, well, maybe
I'm just a little bit sad

43:51.786 --> 43:54.189
that my best friend
is moving across the world.

43:54.189 --> 43:55.756
Well, maybe you could be happy
for me.

43:55.756 --> 43:57.325
That's what best friends
are supposed to do.

43:57.325 --> 43:59.560
- I am happy for you.
- Then act like it.

43:59.560 --> 44:03.064
Are you serious right now?
When am I not happy for you?

44:08.401 --> 44:10.871
Ooh. Ooh.

44:10.871 --> 44:12.440
I'm not doing this now.

44:12.440 --> 44:14.142
Oh, you're not doing this now?

44:14.142 --> 44:16.177
When would be better
for you to do this?

44:16.177 --> 44:18.546
Since everything is always
on your schedule.

44:18.546 --> 44:19.747
I'm at work.

44:19.747 --> 44:20.848
I don't know what happens
at a spa,

44:20.848 --> 44:22.050
but we're professionals here.

44:22.050 --> 44:23.919
Oh, nice. You got a dig in.

44:23.919 --> 44:25.786
Any other judgments
you want to share?

44:25.786 --> 44:27.222
- Oh, please.
- What?

44:27.222 --> 44:28.957
You want to boss me around
a little bit more?

44:28.957 --> 44:30.425
- Boss--
- Tell me how to live my life?

44:30.425 --> 44:31.859
Boss you around?

44:31.859 --> 44:32.688
You're free to do whatever
the fuck you want.

44:32.688 --> 44:33.929
Oh, well...

44:33.929 --> 44:36.031
I know you take that to heart.

44:36.031 --> 44:37.432
What's that supposed to mean?

44:37.432 --> 44:39.434
You always do
whatever the fuck you want.

44:39.434 --> 44:42.270
You feel like making out
with some girl at a club,

44:42.270 --> 44:44.139
then you make out
with some girl at a club.

44:44.139 --> 44:46.141
She asked if she could
kiss me, so I said yes.

44:46.141 --> 44:47.875
Because it's more fun
to say yes.

44:47.875 --> 44:49.310
If you wanted to, you could've
done the same thing.

44:49.310 --> 44:51.112
Why? So you could tell me
I was doing it wrong?

44:51.112 --> 44:54.349
Oh, my God, Lucy,
do shit however you want.

44:54.349 --> 44:56.184
I am not your keeper.

44:56.184 --> 44:58.486
What?
You're always controlling me.

44:58.486 --> 44:59.921
You control everything I do.

44:59.921 --> 45:01.756
You told me when I could eat
a fucking muffin.

45:01.756 --> 45:03.224
Yeah, because if I didn't
tell you what to do,

45:03.224 --> 45:04.792
you'd probably
never leave the house.

45:04.792 --> 45:06.361
You can't make any decisions
on your own.

45:06.361 --> 45:07.929
You don't do anything.

45:07.929 --> 45:09.164
You can't even decide
what gender of the human race

45:09.164 --> 45:11.366
- you want to fuck.
- Fuck you.

45:11.366 --> 45:12.728
You probably
do want to fuck me.

45:12.728 --> 45:14.102
- What?
- Everyone thinks that.

45:14.102 --> 45:15.971
- What are you talking about?

45:15.971 --> 45:17.538
We're not a couple, Lucy.

45:17.538 --> 45:20.308
Nobody thinks we're a couple.
What? Are you insane?

45:20.308 --> 45:22.077
People think we're, like,
confusing twins.

45:22.077 --> 45:23.678
What... what the fuck
is wrong with you?

45:23.678 --> 45:25.346
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

45:25.346 --> 45:27.015
You can't even handle the fact
that I have another friend.

45:27.015 --> 45:28.616
Oh, what a fun friend.

45:28.616 --> 45:30.351
You know what? At least
Kat talks about things.

45:30.351 --> 45:32.087
Yeah. It was
really thrilling to find out

45:32.087 --> 45:34.089
that she can suck a dick
and order Postmates

45:34.089 --> 45:35.957
- at the same time.
- That was thrilling.

45:35.957 --> 45:38.259
And it's fun to hear
crazy fucking stories

45:38.259 --> 45:40.661
instead of wallowing in sorrow
the whole time.

45:40.661 --> 45:41.930
At some point
you're gonna have

45:41.930 --> 45:43.364
to pull your head
out of your own ass.

45:43.364 --> 45:44.599
You think Kat could teach me
how to do that?

45:44.599 --> 45:45.866
I bet you she's tried.

45:45.866 --> 45:47.868
Real friends
tell each other shit.

45:47.868 --> 45:49.170
I tell you everything.

45:49.170 --> 45:51.639
Except the most
important thing.

45:51.639 --> 45:53.141
It's not about you, Jane.

45:53.141 --> 45:54.976
I'm not saying it's about me.

45:54.976 --> 45:57.678
Christ, if anything,
it's all about you.

45:57.678 --> 45:58.947
The only thing
you can focus on

45:58.947 --> 46:01.016
is a lunatic
who touches you a lot,

46:01.016 --> 46:03.318
whose job it is to
touch people for a living.

46:03.318 --> 46:04.619
But this is what you do.

46:04.619 --> 46:07.422
Turn everything around
into this self-pity party.

46:07.422 --> 46:09.890
It can be really scary
to try new things.

46:09.890 --> 46:11.726
When's the last time
you ever took a risk?

46:11.726 --> 46:13.461
I'm moving to fucking London.

46:13.461 --> 46:15.730
Yeah. You're moving back
to where you're from

46:15.730 --> 46:16.831
with your boyfriend,

46:16.831 --> 46:18.833
and on a fucking
expense account.

46:18.833 --> 46:21.069
That's not taking a risk.
That's a whim.

46:21.069 --> 46:23.571
It's an opportunity
to advance my career.

46:23.571 --> 46:25.941
Do you ever think about
actually doing something
for a living?

46:25.941 --> 46:27.075
You know,
it's hard to be a painter

46:27.075 --> 46:28.209
if you stop fucking painting.

46:28.209 --> 46:30.011
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

46:30.011 --> 46:31.746
You know what?

46:31.746 --> 46:33.748
I wouldn't fuck you.
If you were the last person
on Earth,

46:33.748 --> 46:34.882
I wouldn't fuck you.

46:34.882 --> 46:36.684
I feel sorry for you.

46:36.684 --> 46:38.186
Don't. You don't need to.

46:38.186 --> 46:40.455
You obviously don't know
anything about me.

46:40.455 --> 46:42.991
Well, it's not
because I didn't try.

46:43.991 --> 46:45.393
Have a good trip.

46:48.996 --> 46:51.299
Just call her.
- Oh, God.

46:51.299 --> 46:53.969
When do you think
the last time I wore this was?

46:53.969 --> 46:55.670
When you filmed <i>The Wiz?</i>

46:55.670 --> 46:57.105
I don't feel joy.

46:57.105 --> 46:59.574
How could you? It's very ugly.

46:59.574 --> 47:00.808
This is hers.

47:00.808 --> 47:02.377
- Whose?
- Hers.

47:02.377 --> 47:03.878
Her name is Lucy.

47:03.878 --> 47:05.914
She's your best friend.

47:05.914 --> 47:07.415
What, we can't say
her name anymore?

47:07.415 --> 47:08.716
She probably
doesn't even know...

47:08.716 --> 47:11.319
She has, like, 4,000 of these.

47:28.367 --> 47:30.071
<i>So, why don't you
just call her?</i>

47:30.071 --> 47:32.607
Tell her you have it. Make up.

47:32.607 --> 47:33.841
Maybe you won't be sad.

47:33.841 --> 47:35.871
I'm not calling her.
I'm not sad.

47:35.871 --> 47:38.279
I'm done.
She's never happy for me.

47:38.279 --> 47:39.847
So, what, you're just gonna
go to London

47:39.847 --> 47:41.582
and never talk
to your best friend?

47:41.582 --> 47:42.984
Probably.

47:45.120 --> 47:47.188
Oh, I hate
this stupid sweater!

47:47.188 --> 47:50.058
Okay. All right, listen,
this is your favorite sweater.

47:50.058 --> 47:53.161
Now I think we're just
misplacing our feelings.

47:53.161 --> 47:55.230
I just wanted her
to move forward.

47:55.230 --> 47:57.999
I know.
But it's not up to you.

47:57.999 --> 47:59.467
Well, it should be.

47:59.467 --> 48:01.669
You were saying
she called you bossy, right?

48:02.870 --> 48:04.372
Aw, come here.

48:04.372 --> 48:07.508
I know. I know, I know,
I know, I know. Come here.

48:08.608 --> 48:10.906
I'm sorry, baby.

48:10.906 --> 48:12.981
Maybe we should go earlier.

48:12.981 --> 48:15.450
Everything is gonna be okay.

48:15.450 --> 48:17.652
It's just a stressful time
right now.

48:22.023 --> 48:23.624
Are we waiting
on your friend?

48:24.390 --> 48:25.793
Mmm-mmm. No, it's just me.

48:25.793 --> 48:27.828
Oh. What can I get you?

48:27.828 --> 48:32.367
Um, I will have
a veggie burger.

48:32.367 --> 48:33.969
Mmm-hmm. That it?

48:33.969 --> 48:36.837
Um, and an iced coffee, please.

48:36.837 --> 48:38.106
Mmm. Cream?

48:38.106 --> 48:40.608
Yes, please.
Oh, no, actually...

48:40.608 --> 48:42.210
Just... Just black.

49:13.773 --> 49:15.476
Ta-da!

49:15.476 --> 49:16.611
Try-on party!

49:16.611 --> 49:20.916
- Oh, wow. Time to try me on.
- Ooh.

49:20.916 --> 49:22.517
Or whatever.

49:24.617 --> 49:26.121
- Wow.
- Here.

49:26.121 --> 49:30.025
Put this one on.
I'm gonna go grab wine.

49:30.025 --> 49:31.792
Oh, my God.

49:38.031 --> 49:40.768
I feel like we need music.

49:42.670 --> 49:44.739
Ooh, and atmosphere.

49:47.607 --> 49:48.776
Um...

49:49.876 --> 49:50.946
Much better.

49:50.946 --> 49:52.547
There we go.

49:53.813 --> 49:55.550
Look at your cute little body.

49:55.550 --> 49:57.919
Oh, my God.

49:57.919 --> 50:00.288
Wait. Okay.

50:00.288 --> 50:02.090
I'm gonna help you.

50:02.090 --> 50:03.691
Um...

50:03.691 --> 50:04.960
Is that your... Did you...

50:04.960 --> 50:06.561
Why did you put it
over your head?

50:06.561 --> 50:08.129
I don't know.
- You could've just, like,

50:08.129 --> 50:09.764
- stepped into it here. Ooh.

50:09.764 --> 50:12.100
It's gonna look so good
though, once it's on.

50:12.100 --> 50:14.970
- Oh, sorry!

50:14.970 --> 50:16.537
Oh, there's a zipper.

50:19.007 --> 50:21.276
- That's so funny!

50:21.276 --> 50:23.945
That's so funny.
- Here we go.

50:23.945 --> 50:27.082
Oh, my God. Yes, babe!

50:27.876 --> 50:30.418
- Wow.
- You look so hot.

50:30.418 --> 50:32.553
- What?
- I don't use that word
like that.

50:32.553 --> 50:35.256
Luce, you have no idea
how hot you are.

50:35.256 --> 50:38.093
Like, seriously. Turn around.
Look at your ass.

50:38.093 --> 50:39.227
You have to keep that.

50:39.227 --> 50:41.696
I'm a genius. I know.

50:41.696 --> 50:43.731
Where do you even
wear something like this?

50:43.731 --> 50:45.133
Like the clurb.

50:45.133 --> 50:46.634
Where? Is that a restaurant?

50:46.634 --> 50:49.137
The clurb. It's, like,
a funny word for the club.

50:49.137 --> 50:51.172
- Oh, the club? That's right.
- Yes!

50:51.172 --> 50:52.941
- I don't...
- You're keeping that.

50:52.941 --> 50:54.375
This one's next.

50:54.375 --> 50:56.244
Let's take a break.
Let's take a pot break.

50:56.244 --> 50:58.513
- Okay.
- For the anxiety.

50:59.078 --> 51:00.916
You're right.

51:00.916 --> 51:03.079
You know,
colors look good on you.

51:07.253 --> 51:09.257
Gray's a color.

51:10.956 --> 51:13.794
I can't stop thinking
about your paintings.

51:13.794 --> 51:15.263
Please.

51:15.263 --> 51:18.333
No, seriously. Did you, like,

51:18.333 --> 51:21.602
go to fancy art school
or something?

51:24.733 --> 51:26.074
No.

51:26.074 --> 51:27.508
Why not?

51:28.776 --> 51:30.311
I don't know.

51:32.312 --> 51:35.150
Well, why don't you be
a painter?

51:38.719 --> 51:39.787
I don't know.

51:42.721 --> 51:45.460
Why don't you
really try fashion?

51:47.227 --> 51:49.064
'Cause it's hard.

51:49.064 --> 51:51.366
And I'm lazy.

51:51.366 --> 51:53.668
And it's just like a hobby.

51:53.668 --> 51:54.869
But it's a tragedy

51:54.869 --> 51:57.705
because I would've been,
like, a major success.

52:01.842 --> 52:03.178
But you're different.

52:15.555 --> 52:19.694
I feel like there's something
going on here.

52:23.658 --> 52:24.732
Yeah?

52:26.265 --> 52:27.535
So...

52:31.304 --> 52:32.573
Yeah.

53:46.980 --> 53:48.449
What are you doing?

53:48.449 --> 53:50.018
I'm gonna go pee.

54:33.728 --> 54:37.532
I should, um...
I should probably go.

54:41.401 --> 54:42.470
Really?

54:44.172 --> 54:45.806
Yeah, I just have

54:45.806 --> 54:48.743
a lot of errands
to run and stuff,

54:48.743 --> 54:52.413
but thanks for having me over.

54:52.413 --> 54:53.881
That was really fun.

54:56.982 --> 54:59.487
Don't you want
to stay a little while longer?

54:59.487 --> 55:01.722
- Just a little.

55:01.722 --> 55:03.891
Yeah, I do. I...

55:04.490 --> 55:05.860
I gotta go.

55:09.129 --> 55:10.665
Well, thanks for...

55:13.300 --> 55:15.003
- ...everything.

55:22.575 --> 55:24.445
Go back to bed.

55:25.111 --> 55:26.381
Boop.

55:43.263 --> 55:44.432
I love that she thinks

55:44.432 --> 55:45.733
we were sisters
in a past life.

55:45.733 --> 55:47.635
I've always thought that
about us.

55:47.635 --> 55:49.365
Bye, see you guys...

55:49.365 --> 55:50.939
Bye!

55:50.939 --> 55:53.408
- Fucking love that class!
Me, too.

56:00.746 --> 56:02.517
Are you sure?
You don't have to do this.

56:02.517 --> 56:03.584
No, I'm positive.

56:03.584 --> 56:04.852
I actually think it would be

56:04.852 --> 56:06.421
really helpful
to get there sooner.

56:07.087 --> 56:08.289
Great.

56:08.289 --> 56:10.425
And Kat's agreed
to go early also.

56:10.425 --> 56:12.227
Even better!

56:12.227 --> 56:14.462
Anyway, let me know
if you need anything, Jane.

56:14.462 --> 56:15.830
And in the meantime,
I'll make sure

56:15.830 --> 56:17.598
everything is set up for you
across the lake.

56:17.598 --> 56:19.267
Well, thank you again.

56:19.267 --> 56:20.568
No, thank you, Jane.

56:20.568 --> 56:21.869
You're saving me a crapload
of money.

56:21.869 --> 56:24.472
- Start packing. Yeah?

56:32.012 --> 56:32.880
Hey.

56:32.880 --> 56:35.283
- Oh, hi.
- How are you feeling?

56:35.283 --> 56:37.352
Good. You?

56:37.352 --> 56:39.487
Great.
Except, whose idea was it

56:39.487 --> 56:41.589
to drink and smoke so much?

56:41.589 --> 56:44.192
- Yours.
- Oh, yeah. Oops.

56:46.126 --> 56:47.228
Wrong folder.

56:47.228 --> 56:48.763
- I'm still high.

56:48.763 --> 56:50.198
What are you doing tonight?

56:50.198 --> 56:51.299
I can't wait
for this day to be over.

56:51.299 --> 56:52.428
Hmm?

56:52.428 --> 56:54.202
Oh, nothing. I was, um...

56:55.368 --> 56:56.537
I need a nap.

56:58.106 --> 57:00.541
- Me, too.
- Yeah.

57:00.541 --> 57:02.843
Um... Are things weird?

57:04.978 --> 57:06.047
Between us?

57:06.047 --> 57:07.648
Yeah.

57:07.648 --> 57:10.018
No. Why would they be weird?

57:10.018 --> 57:11.352
I had so much fun.

57:11.352 --> 57:13.449
Like, I always
wanted to try that

57:13.449 --> 57:15.290
and we did.

57:15.290 --> 57:17.558
Maybe we can do it again.

57:19.259 --> 57:21.496
Sure. I mean, yeah. I...

57:21.496 --> 57:23.364
I'm free tonight
if you want to...

57:23.364 --> 57:24.565
I mean,
I know it's last minute.

57:24.565 --> 57:27.502
Well, I can't tonight,
but soon.

57:27.502 --> 57:29.104
- Cool.
- Cool.

57:52.926 --> 57:59.867
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

58:01.302 --> 58:05.040

58:05.040 --> 58:08.676

58:11.044 --> 58:13.748

58:13.748 --> 58:16.017
Aw! Thank you, my babe.

58:16.017 --> 58:17.852
You're welcome.
I used to work at IHOP,

58:17.852 --> 58:19.820
- so I know the recipe.

58:19.820 --> 58:21.722
You can share some of that
if you want.

58:21.722 --> 58:22.991
- No, I can't.
- Okay.

58:22.991 --> 58:24.559
- It's your birthday.
- Good to know.

58:24.559 --> 58:25.626
What was I thinking?
What was I thinking?

58:25.626 --> 58:28.229
Hmm. What if she doesn't call?

58:29.295 --> 58:30.565
She will!

58:30.565 --> 58:32.067
But what if she doesn't?

58:32.067 --> 58:34.402
Baby, she will.
Come here. Look.

58:34.402 --> 58:36.532
You know what?

58:36.532 --> 58:39.474
If she doesn't call,
you always got me.

58:39.474 --> 58:40.841
It's not the same.

58:40.841 --> 58:43.178
- None taken.
- I didn't say, "No offense."

58:43.178 --> 58:44.679
Yet you should have.

58:44.679 --> 58:46.014
You know,
we've never not spoken

58:46.014 --> 58:48.049
on our birthdays
for our entire friendship.

58:48.049 --> 58:50.085
I don't even think
we've spent one apart.

58:50.085 --> 58:51.286
Baby...

58:51.286 --> 58:52.921
she is going to call you.

58:52.921 --> 58:55.590
Well, what if she's sad
and she needs me?

58:55.590 --> 58:59.894
Then you both
are gonna talk
about all of that

58:59.894 --> 59:03.898
when she calls. Okay?

59:03.898 --> 59:06.134
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay. Right.

59:06.134 --> 59:07.368
Yeah.

59:07.368 --> 59:08.736
- That's for me? Thank you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:08.736 --> 59:10.838
- Mmm! Mmm!
- You're a monster.

59:14.342 --> 59:15.676
What's up?

59:16.510 --> 59:17.712
Nothing.

59:18.578 --> 59:20.015
It's Jane's birthday today

59:20.015 --> 59:22.483
and, I don't know,
we're still in a fight, so...

59:22.483 --> 59:24.885
- Aw, that sucks.
- Yeah.

59:24.885 --> 59:26.521
What are you up to tonight?

59:26.521 --> 59:29.290
Mmm, I may have dinner
with a friend.

59:29.290 --> 59:32.760
My dumb ex texted me
saying he was in town,

59:32.760 --> 59:35.030
so he might stop by here.

59:35.030 --> 59:35.896
Cool.

59:35.896 --> 59:37.765
Where is this stuff?

59:37.765 --> 59:39.734
Um, bottom drawer.

59:42.903 --> 59:45.806
Thank you. You the best.

59:56.684 --> 59:58.119
Please don't pick up.

59:58.119 --> 59:59.687
Please don't pick up.
Please don't pick up.

01:00:00.987 --> 01:00:02.357
<i>Hey, it's Jane.</i>

01:00:02.357 --> 01:00:04.325
<i>Leave a message. Thank you.</i>

01:00:05.158 --> 01:00:06.861
Hi, um...

01:00:06.861 --> 01:00:09.797
This is me. Uh, it's Lucy.

01:00:09.797 --> 01:00:13.401
Um... I'm just calling to say,

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:17.005
uh, happy birthday to you,

01:00:17.005 --> 01:00:21.409
and, um, many,
many great days.

01:00:22.341 --> 01:00:23.844
Uh...

01:00:23.844 --> 01:00:25.613
I hope you're doing good.

01:00:25.613 --> 01:00:27.682
And I will see you soon.

01:00:27.682 --> 01:00:29.884
I mean, talk to you soon.

01:00:29.884 --> 01:00:31.719
Happy birthday.

01:00:33.388 --> 01:00:34.622
You look great.

01:00:34.622 --> 01:00:36.257
- Okay. Look at you.
- I can't believe

01:00:36.257 --> 01:00:38.059
- how long it's been.
- You look so good.

01:00:39.594 --> 01:00:41.362
You're hilarious.
- Yeah?

01:00:43.095 --> 01:00:47.168
<i>I'm just calling to say
happy birthday to you,</i>

01:00:47.168 --> 01:00:52.040
<i>and, um, many,
many great days.</i>

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.976
<i>Uh, I hope you're doing good.</i>

01:00:54.976 --> 01:00:58.746
<i>And I will see you soon.
I mean, talk to you soon.</i>

01:00:58.746 --> 01:01:00.115
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

01:01:02.681 --> 01:01:05.653
<i>Hi, um, this is me.</i>

01:01:05.653 --> 01:01:07.155
<i>Uh, it's Lucy...</i>

01:01:07.155 --> 01:01:08.589
Jane?

01:01:08.589 --> 01:01:11.059
Hey, when you have a second,
can I see you in my office?

01:01:11.059 --> 01:01:13.328
- Sure. I'll be right there.
- Okay, thanks.

01:01:15.528 --> 01:01:17.198
You guys,
she totally fell for it.

01:01:17.198 --> 01:01:19.400
She's coming. She fell for it.
Here she comes.

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:22.370
- Surprise!
Surprise!

01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:25.440
Happy birthday! Make a wish
for London Town.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:28.209
I told them no cake,
so I'm not tempted to eat any.

01:01:28.209 --> 01:01:29.610
- But I love cake.

01:01:29.610 --> 01:01:30.911
Sorry. I don't want it.

01:01:30.911 --> 01:01:32.247
Can you turn to your left?

01:01:32.247 --> 01:01:34.149
- Happy birthday.
Thank you.

01:01:34.149 --> 01:01:36.017
I have a little something
for you.

01:01:36.017 --> 01:01:37.552
A credit

01:01:37.552 --> 01:01:39.921
to the Tate Modern gift shop.

01:01:39.921 --> 01:01:42.190
It's been in my wallet
for about five years.

01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:44.125
Thank you so much, Mr. Davis.

01:01:44.125 --> 01:01:46.094
You deserve it.
Have a safe trip.

01:01:46.094 --> 01:01:48.163
Oh, I don't leave
for another three weeks.

01:01:48.163 --> 01:01:50.298
- I'm gonna say goodbye now.
- Okay.

01:01:51.665 --> 01:01:53.568
- Open it.
- Oh.

01:01:53.568 --> 01:01:55.436
You didn't have to
get me anything.

01:01:59.605 --> 01:02:00.875
Hammock Sanctuary?

01:02:00.875 --> 01:02:02.877
- Have you been?
- No.

01:02:02.877 --> 01:02:04.812
Oh, my God,
you're gonna love it.

01:02:04.812 --> 01:02:06.881
It's a mind-body
new vibes retreat.

01:02:06.881 --> 01:02:08.349
And everything's in a hammock.

01:02:08.349 --> 01:02:09.550
You eat in a hammock,
you sleep in a hammock,

01:02:09.550 --> 01:02:10.618
you live in a hammock.

01:02:10.618 --> 01:02:11.747
You could have that privilege.

01:02:11.747 --> 01:02:13.488
Oh, my! Uh...

01:02:13.488 --> 01:02:15.023
Wh... where is it?

01:02:15.023 --> 01:02:17.625
In the middle of the woods,
totally off the grid.

01:02:17.625 --> 01:02:19.227
And you're not even supposed
to bring your phone,

01:02:19.227 --> 01:02:20.828
but I will for Insta,
obviously,

01:02:20.828 --> 01:02:22.230
'cause I'm not
a fucking psychopath.

01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:25.066
Smile.
Say, "Hammock girls."

01:02:25.066 --> 01:02:27.002
Hammock gir...
I need to hear it.

01:02:27.002 --> 01:02:29.204
Hammock girls.

01:02:29.204 --> 01:02:30.972
All right,
so, is this a cult?

01:02:30.972 --> 01:02:32.373
'Cause it sounds like a cult.

01:02:32.373 --> 01:02:34.875
It was a gift.
What was I supposed to say?

01:02:34.875 --> 01:02:37.312
You say, "No, thank you,
white lady. I'm good."

01:02:43.377 --> 01:02:44.552
Lucy's not here.

01:02:45.552 --> 01:02:47.488
I know. I'm just...

01:02:47.488 --> 01:02:49.024
- looking at...
- What?

01:02:49.024 --> 01:02:51.292
- ...something.
- Okay.

01:02:54.127 --> 01:02:56.264
I think it's nice
that she called.

01:02:58.098 --> 01:03:00.168
Maybe you should
call her back.

01:03:02.402 --> 01:03:04.039
I think you should.

01:03:04.039 --> 01:03:06.874
She doesn't even know
that I'm leaving earlier.

01:03:06.874 --> 01:03:09.344
You should tell her.

01:03:09.344 --> 01:03:11.879
- Did you already tell her?
- Me?

01:03:12.445 --> 01:03:14.549
No! Nah. Mmm-mmm.

01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:15.917
Mmm-mmm.

01:03:15.917 --> 01:03:19.054
You're being weird.
Why are you being weird?

01:03:19.054 --> 01:03:21.622
Why is everyone
being so fucking weird?

01:03:21.622 --> 01:03:23.558
- What?

01:03:23.558 --> 01:03:25.693
I don't know. I...

01:03:25.693 --> 01:03:28.296
don't think I could go.

01:03:28.296 --> 01:03:31.199
That's fine.
You can come later.

01:03:31.199 --> 01:03:32.934
Yeah.

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:36.237
- Fine. That's fine.
- What?

01:03:36.237 --> 01:03:38.439
- I don't think I could go.

01:03:38.439 --> 01:03:41.977
I just said
you can come whenever.

01:03:44.911 --> 01:03:46.281
I mean "go."

01:03:47.113 --> 01:03:49.584
Like... at all.

01:03:51.317 --> 01:03:53.188
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- What are you talking about?

01:03:53.188 --> 01:03:54.455
I don't want to talk
about this right now.

01:03:54.455 --> 01:03:55.991
Well, you're already
talking about it,

01:03:55.991 --> 01:03:59.060
so...
can you please continue?

01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:02.097
My life... is here.

01:04:03.662 --> 01:04:06.935
- I'm part of your life.
- Yes, yes. Of course.

01:04:06.935 --> 01:04:10.205
I just mean... my job.

01:04:10.205 --> 01:04:14.175
And my family and my friends.

01:04:18.944 --> 01:04:21.482
You didn't even ask me
if I wanted to go.

01:04:22.916 --> 01:04:25.453
You just assumed I would.

01:04:25.453 --> 01:04:29.157
Ah, fuck it. I've just been
thinking about this so much.

01:04:29.157 --> 01:04:31.159
And I love you,
and I want to be with you.

01:04:31.159 --> 01:04:33.528
I really do, but...

01:04:33.528 --> 01:04:36.497
I don't think
I could do it there.

01:04:36.497 --> 01:04:40.001
Maybe, you know,
after a year I'll go.

01:04:40.001 --> 01:04:42.203
Or maybe you'll come back,

01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:44.239
make it work.

01:04:56.116 --> 01:04:58.019
Have a great celebration.

01:06:15.657 --> 01:06:17.198
Hey.

01:06:17.198 --> 01:06:19.434
- Hi.
- You got a sec?

01:06:19.434 --> 01:06:22.637
Yeah, I sure do.
I'm here till 5:00.

01:06:22.637 --> 01:06:24.439
Um...

01:06:24.439 --> 01:06:28.343
I just wanted to talk to you
to let you know...

01:06:28.343 --> 01:06:31.812
that I'm gonna be going
to Portland in a month.

01:06:31.812 --> 01:06:35.750
Yeah, and I'll probably be
there for a little while.

01:06:37.083 --> 01:06:38.987
Great.

01:06:38.987 --> 01:06:40.555
- For the ex?
- Yeah.

01:06:40.555 --> 01:06:44.359
I don't know if we're, like...
getting back together

01:06:44.359 --> 01:06:47.023
or if this is the worst idea
in the world...

01:06:48.696 --> 01:06:51.132
But I just... I wanted
to tell you because...

01:06:51.132 --> 01:06:53.334
It's okay. Yeah.

01:06:53.334 --> 01:06:54.669
Well, 'cause you...

01:06:56.931 --> 01:06:58.806
'Cause you make the schedule.

01:06:59.534 --> 01:07:01.109
Right.

01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:03.744
Yeah. Mmm-hmm. Thank you.

01:07:04.544 --> 01:07:07.282
- Are we okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:07:07.282 --> 01:07:09.717
- Yeah, we're okay.
- Okay.

01:07:09.717 --> 01:07:11.047
Cool.

01:07:13.119 --> 01:07:14.189
Love ya.

01:08:09.909 --> 01:08:11.146
Are you serious?

01:08:15.482 --> 01:08:16.551
Wow.

01:08:17.284 --> 01:08:19.115
I wasn't expecting that.

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:21.589
Are you sure?

01:08:22.822 --> 01:08:26.894
And you're just realizing
this recently?

01:08:28.128 --> 01:08:31.232
I think I've known
for a while.

01:08:32.894 --> 01:08:34.835
Have you been with girls?

01:08:34.835 --> 01:08:36.904
Mmm-hmm. One.

01:08:37.904 --> 01:08:39.274
Did you like it?

01:08:41.974 --> 01:08:45.914
I think maybe I liked it
a little bit more than she did.

01:08:45.914 --> 01:08:47.082
Mmm.

01:08:47.082 --> 01:08:48.749
Do you want me to destroy her?

01:08:50.251 --> 01:08:52.220
I'm not really sure
what to say.

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:56.224
You can say anything.

01:08:56.224 --> 01:08:58.526
So, do you have a type?

01:08:58.526 --> 01:09:01.129
No. I don't know.

01:09:01.129 --> 01:09:04.265
I like brunettes
with long hair

01:09:04.265 --> 01:09:06.935
who are attracted to women.

01:09:06.935 --> 01:09:08.636
- It's funny,

01:09:08.636 --> 01:09:10.305
I always felt like
you treated me

01:09:10.305 --> 01:09:11.839
like your gay best friend.

01:09:11.839 --> 01:09:13.908
But, uh, it turns out
you're mine.

01:09:13.908 --> 01:09:15.776
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:09:15.776 --> 01:09:17.173
I'm sorry that I...

01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:21.316
couldn't tell you.

01:09:22.482 --> 01:09:24.219
I'm sorry about the girl.

01:09:25.886 --> 01:09:27.255
It's all good.

01:09:30.156 --> 01:09:31.526
Good night, Ben.

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:34.829

That's... I don't know
how you guys do it.

01:10:04.559 --> 01:10:06.661
I'm not cool with needles.

01:10:06.661 --> 01:10:09.764
Oh, but it's so satisfying
when you get the vein.

I'm an artist.

01:10:27.047 --> 01:10:28.483
Bathroom.

01:10:28.483 --> 01:10:30.246

01:10:30.246 --> 01:10:32.320
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.754

That's crazy.

01:10:51.306 --> 01:10:52.907
- No, I'll get it.
- No!

01:10:54.342 --> 01:10:56.911
Uh, no, I'm gonna get it.
You can get the next one.

01:10:57.744 --> 01:10:58.613
Okay.

01:10:59.612 --> 01:11:01.649
We can go for a small pizza.

01:11:01.649 --> 01:11:02.583
Wow.

01:11:02.583 --> 01:11:04.152
That's generous of you.

01:11:04.152 --> 01:11:06.354
But no sides, okay?

01:11:06.354 --> 01:11:10.091

01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:42.657
- Welcome...
to the Hammock Sanctuary.

01:11:42.657 --> 01:11:45.927
Like the bosoms
of our foremothers,

01:11:45.927 --> 01:11:49.931
the hammock cradles us.

01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:53.601
If the trees of the forest
are our legs...

01:11:54.534 --> 01:11:57.738
the hammock is our vulva.

01:11:57.738 --> 01:12:00.808
Let's close our eyes
and allow ourselves

01:12:00.808 --> 01:12:05.046
to be enveloped
by our mesh cocoons.

01:12:07.347 --> 01:12:10.346
We are all seeds
of the universe,

01:12:10.346 --> 01:12:13.254
and soon we will
begin to bloom.

01:12:21.627 --> 01:12:23.359
Let's close our eyes.

01:12:25.398 --> 01:12:26.767
Let's close them.

01:12:28.267 --> 01:12:30.838
- And we'll close them.
- Okay.

01:12:30.838 --> 01:12:32.640
- Okay, close your eyes.
- I will.

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.442
Well, you're not closing them.

01:12:35.708 --> 01:12:38.413
As we open our throat chakra,

01:12:38.413 --> 01:12:41.449
I encourage you all

01:12:41.449 --> 01:12:44.419
to release your voice

01:12:44.419 --> 01:12:47.555
as ferociously
as the Vishuddha...

01:12:47.555 --> 01:12:50.158
- ...will allow.

01:12:54.227 --> 01:12:55.863
That was nice, Kat.

01:12:58.099 --> 01:12:59.467
Would it help if I rocked you?

01:12:59.467 --> 01:13:00.936
No, I'm okay, thank you.

01:13:00.936 --> 01:13:03.104
Let me rock you.
I'm good.

01:13:03.104 --> 01:13:05.006
It'd be best if I rocked you.

01:13:07.108 --> 01:13:09.477
You need to let it out.
It's in here.

01:13:09.477 --> 01:13:11.479
- It's right in there.

01:13:11.479 --> 01:13:13.081
It needs to come out.

01:13:18.753 --> 01:13:21.589
Okay, well... Jesus Christ.

01:14:18.979 --> 01:14:20.048
Hi.

01:14:29.688 --> 01:14:30.891
What are you gonna get?

01:14:31.758 --> 01:14:33.794
Um., maybe an omelet.

01:14:33.794 --> 01:14:35.997
- That sounds good.
- Mmm.

01:14:37.330 --> 01:14:38.733
You girls ready?

01:14:38.733 --> 01:14:41.869
Yeah. May I have an omelet
with tomato and spinach?

01:14:41.869 --> 01:14:44.272
Mmm-hmm.
- Please. And an iced coffee.

01:14:44.272 --> 01:14:45.941
Thank you.

01:14:45.941 --> 01:14:48.876
I'll do the Chinese chicken
salad and a green tea. Thanks.

01:14:49.876 --> 01:14:51.346
No more veggie burgers?

01:14:51.346 --> 01:14:53.982
Just switching it up.

01:14:53.982 --> 01:14:56.784
- Wild!

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.756
So, when do you leave?

01:15:01.756 --> 01:15:03.724
I'm going early, actually.

01:15:03.724 --> 01:15:05.493
I leave next week.

01:15:05.493 --> 01:15:07.262
Next... Wow, that's...

01:15:07.262 --> 01:15:10.231
What made you want to do that?

01:15:10.231 --> 01:15:12.333
Danny's not going anymore.

01:15:12.333 --> 01:15:14.035
You and I were in a fight.

01:15:14.035 --> 01:15:17.072
It's easier to leave than deal
with those things, I suppose.

01:15:17.072 --> 01:15:18.739
Danny's not going?

01:15:19.707 --> 01:15:21.476
Why? What happened?

01:15:21.476 --> 01:15:24.345
He said
he likes his life here.

01:15:24.345 --> 01:15:26.781
Which is fine.

01:15:28.615 --> 01:15:31.486
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

01:15:31.486 --> 01:15:32.921
It's fine.

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:35.856
It's fine.

01:15:35.856 --> 01:15:37.825
What have you been up to?

01:15:38.892 --> 01:15:40.428
Well, I... I quit the spa.

01:15:40.428 --> 01:15:44.132
Holy shit!
That's amazing, Lucy.
Good for you.

01:15:44.132 --> 01:15:46.634
Thanks.
I started painting again.

01:15:46.634 --> 01:15:48.136
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:15:48.136 --> 01:15:49.304
That's great!

01:15:51.170 --> 01:15:53.774
And I've been
on some girl dates.

01:15:53.774 --> 01:15:56.511
What?
You don't start with that?

01:15:56.511 --> 01:15:58.646
- I'm just taking it slow.
- Wow!

01:15:58.646 --> 01:16:00.215
Okay,
you're playing it so cool.

01:16:00.215 --> 01:16:02.217
What happened
with BB Brit-Brit?

01:16:02.217 --> 01:16:04.652
Oh, BB Brit-Brit, yes.

01:16:04.652 --> 01:16:06.354
Um, she's straight.

01:16:06.354 --> 01:16:08.656
Ah, I doubt that very much.

01:16:10.256 --> 01:16:11.659
Yeah.

01:16:11.659 --> 01:16:12.994
We had a try-on party.

01:16:12.994 --> 01:16:15.591
- That is not a thing.
- It is a thing.

01:16:15.591 --> 01:16:17.665
Okay, did you make out?

01:16:17.665 --> 01:16:19.367
- Did you make out?

01:16:19.367 --> 01:16:22.503
You may ask me some questions
that I will say yes or no to.

01:16:22.503 --> 01:16:24.305
Okay. Boobs in mouth?

01:16:24.305 --> 01:16:25.873
Wow. Um, yes.

01:16:25.873 --> 01:16:27.108
Did you go down on her?

01:16:27.108 --> 01:16:29.744
- No.
- Did she go down on you?

01:16:29.744 --> 01:16:32.147
- Yes.
- Um, did you finger-bang her?

01:16:32.147 --> 01:16:34.349
- Oh, my God.
- Butt stuff? Any butt stuff?

01:16:34.349 --> 01:16:36.884
What? Butt stuff?
Jane, that is hardcore.

01:16:36.884 --> 01:16:38.753
You definitely did butt stuff.

01:16:39.753 --> 01:16:41.256
- No.
- Yeah!

01:16:41.256 --> 01:16:43.024
Oh, my God. We don't need
to talk about it.

01:16:43.024 --> 01:16:46.294
I just can't believe
I missed all of this.

01:16:49.897 --> 01:16:51.899
I'm... I'm...

01:16:51.899 --> 01:16:54.369
I'm really sorry, Lucy.

01:16:57.204 --> 01:17:00.308
- You don't have to apologize.
- Yes, I do.

01:17:00.308 --> 01:17:01.977
And I really am.

01:17:01.977 --> 01:17:05.346
I was just...
I don't know, I was...

01:17:05.346 --> 01:17:06.781
I was frustrated.

01:17:06.781 --> 01:17:09.384
You were so stuck,
I was just trying to help.

01:17:09.384 --> 01:17:10.986
Yeah, I know.

01:17:10.986 --> 01:17:12.153
I don't know
why I've always been

01:17:12.153 --> 01:17:13.989
so set on solving
your problems.

01:17:13.989 --> 01:17:16.191
Hmm. Hmm.

01:17:16.191 --> 01:17:18.359
- May I venture a guess?

01:17:18.359 --> 01:17:19.655
Have at it.

01:17:19.655 --> 01:17:22.463
I think that perhaps,
I don't know,

01:17:22.463 --> 01:17:26.567
maybe it's easier to focus
on someone else's problems

01:17:26.567 --> 01:17:28.803
than face your own,

01:17:28.803 --> 01:17:32.540
and perhaps
there's some control issues

01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:35.671
from being forced to move here
when you were a teenager.

01:17:35.671 --> 01:17:37.645
No, that's not it.

01:17:37.645 --> 01:17:39.347
Oh, yeah, that's not it?

01:17:41.582 --> 01:17:43.384
I took you for granted.

01:17:43.384 --> 01:17:45.886
I don't know why it took
swinging in a dirty hammock

01:17:45.886 --> 01:17:48.789
for me to realize that
I really fucking need you.

01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:50.291
Oh, I hate this!

01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:51.960
I feel like I've skipped
a whole season of your life.

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.328
What am I gonna miss

01:17:53.328 --> 01:17:54.595
when I'm on the other side
of the world?

01:17:54.595 --> 01:17:56.965
Probably butt stuff.

01:17:56.965 --> 01:17:59.734
Okay, can we figure out
when you'll visit?

01:17:59.734 --> 01:18:01.569
Yeah, I'll come
when you get settled.

01:18:01.569 --> 01:18:03.404
In two weeks?

01:18:03.404 --> 01:18:05.473
Jane, you're gonna be okay.

01:18:05.473 --> 01:18:06.841
You're gonna love being there.

01:18:06.841 --> 01:18:08.409
It's your home.

01:18:08.409 --> 01:18:11.179
I mean,
you speak the language.
That's good.

01:18:11.179 --> 01:18:14.415
You make super-annoying
friends, like, really easily.

01:18:14.415 --> 01:18:16.517
You're gonna find a new me in,
like, a week.

01:18:16.517 --> 01:18:19.354
I will never find a new you.

01:18:19.354 --> 01:18:21.422
I don't wanna miss
your first girlfriend.

01:18:24.023 --> 01:18:25.560
Do you have a ride
to the airport?

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:26.694
Do you want me to take you?

01:18:26.694 --> 01:18:28.463
No, you are a terrible driver.

01:18:28.463 --> 01:18:32.533
I'm not. I feel that I'm
actually a really good driver.
One car--

01:18:32.533 --> 01:18:35.370
You have to see what's going
on behind you right now.

01:18:37.238 --> 01:18:39.240
- Oh, my God! Wow!

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.909
The whole thing? I've never
thought of doing that.

01:18:41.909 --> 01:18:44.779
- But I will now.
- That is great.

01:18:51.317 --> 01:18:53.121
Whoo! London Town!

01:18:53.121 --> 01:18:56.491
- You sound like Kat.
- Wow.

01:18:56.491 --> 01:19:00.528
That's actually the meanest
thing you've ever said to me.

01:19:00.528 --> 01:19:02.697
And you've said some really
fucked-up shit.

01:19:02.697 --> 01:19:04.760
Oh.

01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:07.268
Yeah.

01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:10.939
Okay.

01:19:15.007 --> 01:19:17.912
- Cheer up, buttercup.
- Oh, please. No.

01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:21.349
Oh.

01:19:21.349 --> 01:19:22.817
Is it still broken?

01:19:22.817 --> 01:19:25.086
I thought you got that fixed.

01:19:25.086 --> 01:19:27.555
Yeah, well,
you just have to open it
from the inside.

01:19:27.555 --> 01:19:28.990
It's not broken.

01:19:28.990 --> 01:19:31.259
That sounds really safe.

01:19:31.259 --> 01:19:33.194
Okay!

01:19:33.793 --> 01:19:35.330
Here we go.

01:19:35.330 --> 01:19:37.532
- Oh!
- Oh, Jesus! Shall we swap?

01:19:38.765 --> 01:19:40.135
That's it.

01:19:43.138 --> 01:19:44.239
Okay.

01:19:44.239 --> 01:19:47.375
Whoo!
Jesus!

01:19:52.612 --> 01:19:54.215
Why are you smiling?

01:19:54.215 --> 01:19:58.419
Um... What?
Because I'm happy for you.

01:19:58.419 --> 01:20:00.355
This is really exciting.

01:20:04.818 --> 01:20:07.195
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm great.

01:20:07.195 --> 01:20:09.430
I'm also... You know,
I'm happy for me, too.

01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:11.799
Because I won't be here
to boss you around?

01:20:11.799 --> 01:20:15.003
No, because
I'm coming with you.

01:20:15.003 --> 01:20:16.437
- What?
- I'm coming.

01:20:16.437 --> 01:20:20.675
I'm gonna come on this plane
to London Town.

01:20:20.675 --> 01:20:22.243
What are you talking about?

01:20:22.243 --> 01:20:24.012
I know that you really like
to tell me what I need,

01:20:24.012 --> 01:20:27.182
but I know what you need also.

01:20:27.182 --> 01:20:30.318
And that is me, so I'm coming

01:20:30.318 --> 01:20:33.388
for emotional support
and overall encouragement.

01:20:33.388 --> 01:20:35.523
- Are you serious?
- Well, yes!

01:20:35.523 --> 01:20:37.758
You had shaky voice
at the diner.

01:20:37.758 --> 01:20:39.794
No, I didn't. It was the wind.

01:20:39.794 --> 01:20:42.964
- You were trembling.
- How long are you gonna stay?

01:20:42.964 --> 01:20:44.532
Well, I don't know.

01:20:44.532 --> 01:20:47.668
Maybe a fortnight. That means
two weeks in England.

01:20:47.668 --> 01:20:49.804
- Okay?
- Yeah, I know
what a fortnight is.

01:20:49.804 --> 01:20:51.739
It's just to get you settled,
you know?

01:20:51.739 --> 01:20:53.408
This is crazy!

01:20:53.408 --> 01:20:55.843
And I brought you a muffin.

01:20:55.843 --> 01:20:58.579
You can have half
when we take off
and half over New York.

01:20:59.875 --> 01:21:02.817
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

01:21:02.817 --> 01:21:04.119
We're going to London
together.

01:21:04.119 --> 01:21:05.686
I know. It's great. Hey, no.

01:21:05.686 --> 01:21:09.790
I said half when we take off
and half over New York.

01:21:09.790 --> 01:21:11.192
You're so bossy.

01:21:11.192 --> 01:21:13.094
Yeah, well, that's who
I am now. I'm in charge.

01:21:13.094 --> 01:21:15.063
What are you gonna do
with your car?

01:21:17.531 --> 01:21:19.234
Oh.

01:21:19.234 --> 01:21:22.237
Um, I'm gonna,
uh, park it.

01:21:22.237 --> 01:21:23.738
What about your passport?

01:21:23.738 --> 01:21:25.606
I have it in my bag.

01:21:25.606 --> 01:21:28.343
Has it expired?
They expire?

01:21:28.343 --> 01:21:29.777
Do you have luggage?

01:21:29.777 --> 01:21:31.246
I have a carry-on.

01:21:31.246 --> 01:21:32.680
You're gonna need
a warmer jacket than that.

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:35.316
No. Okay, that's enough.
No more talking.
